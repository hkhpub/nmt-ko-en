we're at a tipping point in human history, a species poised between gaining the stars and losing the planet we call home.

NASA's Kepler mission has discovered thousands of potential planets around other stars, indicating that Earth is but one of billions of planets in our galaxy.

Kepler is a space telescope that measures the subtle dimming of stars as planets pass in front of them, blocking just a little bit of that light from reaching us.

Kepler's data reveals planets' sizes as well as their distance from their parent star.
K ep ler _ '_ s_ da ta _ re ve al s_ planets_ ' \ 3 2 ;_ si ze s_ as_ well _ as_ their_ dist ance_ from_ their_ pare nt_ star _ ._

together, this helps us understand whether these planets are small and rocky, like the terrestrial planets in our own Solar System, and also how much light they receive from their parent sun.

in turn, this provides clues as to whether these planets that we discover might be habitable or not.

unfortunately, at the same time as we're discovering this treasure trove of potentially habitable worlds, our own planet is sagging under the weight of humanity.

now, as somebody who is deeply embedded in the search for life in the universe, I can tell you that the more you look for planets like Earth, the more you appreciate our own planet itself.

Mars is small and rocky, and though it's a bit far from the Sun, it might be considered a potentially habitable world if found by a mission like Kepler.

I worry -- I worry that this excitement about colonizing Mars and other planets carries with it a long, dark shadow: the implication and belief by some that Mars will be there to save us from the self-inflicted destruction of the only truly habitable planet we know of, the Earth.

there are many excellent reasons to go to Mars, but for anyone to tell you that Mars will be there to back up humanity is like the captain of the Titanic telling you that the real party is happening later on the lifeboats.

but the goals of interplanetary exploration and planetary preservation are not opposed to one another.

no, they're in fact two sides of the same goal: to understand, preserve and improve life into the future.

if we can understand how to create and maintain habitable spaces out of hostile, inhospitable spaces here on Earth, perhaps we can meet the needs of both preserving our own environment and moving beyond it.

I leave you with a final thought experiment: Fermi's paradox.
I_ lea ve_ you_ with_ a_ fin al_ thought_ expe ri ment_ : \ 3 2 ;_ F erm i _ '_ s_ pa ra do x _ ._

many years ago, the physicist Enrico Fermi asked that, given the fact that our universe has been around for a very long time and we expect that there are many planets within it, we should have found evidence for alien life by now.
many_ years_ ago _ , \ 3 2 ;_ the_ ph ys ici st_ E n ri co _ F erm i _ asked_ that_ , \ 3 2 ;_ give n_ the_ fact _ that_ our_ uni vers e_ has_ been_ around_ for_ a_ very_ long _ time_ and_ we_ expe ct_ that_ there_ are_ many_ planets_ wi thin _ it_ , \ 3 2 ;_ we_ should_ have_ found_ ev ide nce _ for_ ali en_ life_ by_ now_ ._

so where are they?
so_ where_ are_ they_ ?_

well, one possible solution to Fermi's paradox is that, as civilizations become technologically advanced enough to consider living amongst the stars, they lose sight of how important it is to safeguard the home worlds that fostered that advancement to begin with.
well _ , \ 3 2 ;_ one_ possib le_ sol uti on_ to_ F erm i _ '_ s_ pa ra do x _ is_ that_ , \ 3 2 ;_ as_ ci vi li z ation s_ become_ tec hn ologi call y_ ad va nce d_ en ou gh _ to_ consider _ livi ng_ am ong st_ the_ star s_ , \ 3 2 ;_ they_ los e_ si ght _ of_ how_ impo rt ant _ it_ is_ to_ sa fe gu ar d_ the_ home _ world s_ that_ fo ste red_ that_ ad va nce ment_ to_ beg in_ with_ ._

it is hubris to believe that interplanetary colonization alone will save us from ourselves, but planetary preservation and interplanetary exploration can work together.
it_ is_ hu bri s_ to_ believe_ that_ inter planetary _ colo ni z ation_ alon e_ will_ sa ve_ us_ from_ ou rsel ves_ , \ 3 2 ;_ but_ planetary _ pres erv ation_ and_ inter planetary _ expl orat ion_ can_ work_ together_ ._

if we truly believe in our ability to bend the hostile environments of Mars for human habitation, then we should be able to surmount the far easier task of preserving the habitability of the Earth.

a few years ago, I broke into my own house.
a_ few_ years_ ago _ , \ 3 2 ;_ I_ bro ke_ into_ my_ own_ ho use _ ._

I had just driven home, it was around midnight in the dead of Montreal winter, I had been visiting my friend, Jeff, across town, and the thermometer on the front porch read minus 40 degrees -- and don't bother asking if that's Celsius or Fahrenheit, minus 40 is where the two scales meet -- it was very cold.
I_ had_ just_ dri ve n_ home _ , \ 3 2 ;_ it_ was_ around_ mi d night_ in_ the_ dea d_ of_ M ont real _ wi nte r_ , \ 3 2 ;_ I_ had_ been_ vis iti ng_ my_ friend _ , \ 3 2 ;_ J e ff _ , \ 3 2 ;_ across_ to w n_ , \ 3 2 ;_ and_ the_ ther mo met er_ on_ the_ front_ po rc h_ read _ min us_ 40 _ de gre es_ \ 3 2 ; - - \ 3 2 ;_ and_ do n_ '_ t_ bot her_ ask ing_ if_ that_ '_ s_ C els i us_ or_ F ah ren he it_ , \ 3 2 ;_ min us_ 40 _ is_ where_ the_ two_ scale s_ me et_ \ 3 2 ; - - \ 3 2 ;_ it_ was_ very_ col d_ ._

and as I stood on the front porch fumbling in my pockets, I found I didn't have my keys.
and_ as_ I_ sto od_ on_ the_ front_ po rc h_ fu mbl ing_ in_ my_ po ck et s_ , \ 3 2 ;_ I_ found_ I_ di d n_ '_ t_ have_ my_ ke ys_ ._

in fact, I could see them through the window, lying on the dining room table where I had left them.
in_ fact _ , \ 3 2 ;_ I_ could_ see_ them_ through_ the_ window _ , \ 3 2 ;_ ly ing_ on_ the_ di ning _ ro om _ table _ where_ I_ had_ le ft _ them_ ._

so I quickly ran around and tried all the other doors and windows, and they were locked tight.
so_ I_ qui ckl y_ ra n_ around_ and_ tri ed_ all_ the_ other_ do ors _ and_ window s_ , \ 3 2 ;_ and_ they_ were_ lo ck ed_ ti ght _ ._

I thought about calling a locksmith -- at least I had my cellphone, but at midnight, it could take a while for a locksmith to show up, and it was cold.
I_ thought_ about_ call ing_ a_ lo ck sm ith _ \ 3 2 ; - - \ 3 2 ;_ at_ lea st_ I_ had_ my_ cel l ph one_ , \ 3 2 ;_ but_ at_ mi d night_ , \ 3 2 ;_ it_ could_ take_ a_ while_ for_ a_ lo ck sm ith _ to_ sho w_ up_ , \ 3 2 ;_ and_ it_ was_ col d_ ._

I couldn't go back to my friend Jeff's house for the night because I had an early flight to Europe the next morning, and I needed to get my passport and my suitcase.
I_ cou ld n_ '_ t_ go_ back_ to_ my_ friend _ J e ff _ '_ s_ ho use _ for_ the_ night_ because_ I_ had_ an_ ear ly_ fl ight _ to_ E ur ope _ the_ next_ mor ning _ , \ 3 2 ;_ and_ I_ need ed_ to_ get_ my_ pass port _ and_ my_ su it case _ ._

so, desperate and freezing cold, I found a large rock and I broke through the basement window, cleared out the shards of glass, I crawled through, I found a piece of cardboard and taped it up over the opening, figuring that in the morning, on the way to the airport, I could call my contractor and ask him to fix it.
so_ , \ 3 2 ;_ des per ate_ and_ free z ing_ col d_ , \ 3 2 ;_ I_ found_ a_ large _ ro ck_ and_ I_ bro ke_ through_ the_ bas em ent_ window _ , \ 3 2 ;_ clear ed_ out_ the_ sha rd s_ of_ gla ss_ , \ 3 2 ;_ I_ cr aw led _ through_ , \ 3 2 ;_ I_ found_ a_ piece _ of_ car d bo ar d_ and_ ta pe d_ it_ up_ over_ the_ ope ning _ , \ 3 2 ;_ fi gu ring_ that_ in_ the_ mor ning _ , \ 3 2 ;_ on_ the_ way_ to_ the_ air port _ , \ 3 2 ;_ I_ could_ call_ my_ contr act or_ and_ ask_ hi m_ to_ fi x _ it_ ._

this was going to be expensive, but probably no more expensive than a middle-of-the-night locksmith, so I figured, under the circumstances, I was coming out even.
this_ was_ going_ to_ be_ expe ns ive_ , \ 3 2 ;_ but_ pro bab ly_ no_ more_ expe ns ive_ than_ a_ mi dd le_ - _ of_ - _ the_ - _ night_ lo ck sm ith _ , \ 3 2 ;_ so_ I_ figure d_ , \ 3 2 ;_ under_ the_ ci rc um sta nce s_ , \ 3 2 ;_ I_ was_ com ing_ out_ even_ ._

now, I'm a neuroscientist by training and I know a little bit about how the brain performs under stress.

so the next morning, when I woke up on too little sleep, worrying about the hole in the window, and a mental note that I had to call my contractor, and the freezing temperatures, and the meetings I had upcoming in Europe, and, you know, with all the cortisol in my brain, my thinking was cloudy, but I didn't know it was cloudy because my thinking was cloudy.
so_ the_ next_ mor ning _ , \ 3 2 ;_ when_ I_ wo ke_ up_ on_ too_ little_ sl ee p_ , \ 3 2 ;_ wor ry ing_ about_ the_ ho le_ in_ the_ window _ , \ 3 2 ;_ and_ a_ ment al_ not e_ that_ I_ had_ to_ call_ my_ contr act or_ , \ 3 2 ;_ and_ the_ free z ing_ tem per ature s_ , \ 3 2 ;_ and_ the_ me eti ng s_ I_ had_ up com ing_ in_ E ur ope _ , \ 3 2 ;_ and_ , \ 3 2 ;_ you_ know_ , \ 3 2 ;_ with_ all_ the_ cor ti sol _ in_ my_ brain_ , \ 3 2 ;_ my_ thinking_ was_ cloud y_ , \ 3 2 ;_ but_ I_ di d n_ '_ t_ know_ it_ was_ cloud y_ because_ my_ thinking_ was_ cloud y_ ._

and it wasn't until I got to the airport check-in counter, that I realized I didn't have my passport.
and_ it_ wa s n_ '_ t_ until_ I_ got_ to_ the_ air port _ che ck_ - _ in_ cou nte r_ , \ 3 2 ;_ that_ I_ realized _ I_ di d n_ '_ t_ have_ my_ pass port _ ._

so I raced home in the snow and ice, 40 minutes, got my passport, raced back to the airport, I made it just in time, but they had given away my seat to someone else, so I got stuck in the back of the plane, next to the bathrooms, in a seat that wouldn't recline, on an eight-hour flight.
so_ I_ rac ed_ home _ in_ the_ s now_ and_ ic e_ , \ 3 2 ;_ 40 _ min ut es_ , \ 3 2 ;_ got_ my_ pass port _ , \ 3 2 ;_ rac ed_ back_ to_ the_ air port _ , \ 3 2 ;_ I_ made_ it_ just_ in_ time_ , \ 3 2 ;_ but_ they_ had_ give n_ away_ my_ sea t_ to_ someone_ els e_ , \ 3 2 ;_ so_ I_ got_ stu ck_ in_ the_ back_ of_ the_ plan e_ , \ 3 2 ;_ next_ to_ the_ ba thr o om s_ , \ 3 2 ;_ in_ a_ sea t_ that_ wo ul d n_ '_ t_ rec line _ , \ 3 2 ;_ on_ an_ ei ght _ - _ ho ur _ fl ight _ ._

well, I had a lot of time to think during those eight hours and no sleep.
well _ , \ 3 2 ;_ I_ had_ a_ lot_ of_ time_ to_ think_ du ring_ those_ ei ght _ ho ur s_ and_ no_ sl ee p_ ._

and I started wondering, are there things that I can do, systems that I can put into place, that will prevent bad things from happening?

I was having dinner with my colleague, Danny Kahneman, the Nobel Prize winner, and I somewhat embarrassedly told him about having broken my window, and, you know, forgotten my passport, and Danny shared with me that he'd been practicing something called prospective hindsight.
I_ was_ havi ng_ di n ner _ with_ my_ colle ag ue _ , \ 3 2 ;_ D an n y_ K ah ne man _ , \ 3 2 ;_ the_ N ob el _ P ri ze _ wi n ner _ , \ 3 2 ;_ and_ I_ some what_ emb ar ra ss ed ly_ to ld _ hi m_ about_ havi ng_ bro ke n_ my_ window _ , \ 3 2 ;_ and_ , \ 3 2 ;_ you_ know_ , \ 3 2 ;_ for go tte n_ my_ pass port _ , \ 3 2 ;_ and_ D an n y_ sha red_ with_ me_ that_ he_ '_ d_ been_ p rac tic ing_ something_ called_ pro spec ti ve_ hin ds ight _ ._

it's something that he had gotten from the psychologist Gary Klein, who had written about it a few years before, also called the pre-mortem.

now, you all know what the postmortem is.

whenever there's a disaster, a team of experts come in and they try to figure out what went wrong, right?

well, in the pre-mortem, Danny explained, you look ahead and you try to figure out all the things that could go wrong, and then you try to figure out what you can do to prevent those things from happening, or to minimize the damage.
well _ , \ 3 2 ;_ in_ the_ pre _ - _ mor tem _ , \ 3 2 ;_ D an n y_ expl ain ed_ , \ 3 2 ;_ you_ look_ ah ea d_ and_ you_ try_ to_ figure _ out_ all_ the_ things_ that_ could_ go_ wrong_ , \ 3 2 ;_ and_ then_ you_ try_ to_ figure _ out_ what_ you_ can_ do_ to_ prev ent_ those_ things_ from_ happen ing_ , \ 3 2 ;_ or_ to_ min im ize _ the_ da mag e_ ._

so what I want to talk to you about today are some of the things we can do in the form of a pre-mortem.

and if you're wondering, somebody actually did the experiment where they cut off the olfactory sense of the squirrels, and they could still find their nuts.
and_ if_ you_ '_ re_ wo nd ering _ , \ 3 2 ;_ some body_ act ually_ did_ the_ expe ri ment_ where_ they_ cut _ off _ the_ ol fact ory _ sens e_ of_ the_ s qui rr els _ , \ 3 2 ;_ and_ they_ could_ still_ find_ their_ nu ts_ ._

they weren't using smell, they were using the hippocampus, this exquisitely evolved mechanism in the brain for finding things.

so this is why we lose car keys and reading glasses and passports.

what about travel?

take a cell phone picture of your credit cards, your driver's license, your passport, mail it to yourself so it's in the cloud.

if these things are lost or stolen, you can facilitate replacement.

remember, when you're under stress, the brain releases cortisol.
reme mber _ , \ 3 2 ;_ when_ you_ '_ re_ under_ stre ss_ , \ 3 2 ;_ the_ brain_ rel eas es_ cor ti sol _ ._

cortisol is toxic, and it causes cloudy thinking.
cor ti sol _ is_ to x ic_ , \ 3 2 ;_ and_ it_ cause s_ cloud y_ thinking_ ._

so part of the practice of the pre-mortem is to recognize that under stress you're not going to be at your best, and you should put systems in place.
so_ part_ of_ the_ p rac tic e_ of_ the_ pre _ - _ mor tem _ is_ to_ rec og ni ze _ that_ under_ stre ss_ you_ '_ re_ not_ going_ to_ be_ at_ your_ bes t_ , \ 3 2 ;_ and_ you_ should_ put_ system s_ in_ place_ ._

and there's perhaps no more stressful a situation than when you're confronted with a medical decision to make.
and_ there_ '_ s_ per ha p s_ no_ more_ stre ss ful_ a_ si tu ation_ than_ when_ you_ '_ re_ conf ron ted _ with_ a_ medical_ deci sion _ to_ make_ ._

and at some point, all of us are going to be in that position, where we have to make a very important decision about the future of our medical care or that of a loved one, to help them with a decision.

and so I want to talk about that.
and_ so_ I_ want_ to_ talk_ about_ that_ ._

and I'm going to talk about a very particular medical condition.
and_ I_ '_ m_ going_ to_ talk_ about_ a_ very_ particular _ medical_ con di tion_ ._

but this stands as a proxy for all kinds of medical decision-making, and indeed for financial decision-making, and social decision-making -- any kind of decision you have to make that would benefit from a rational assessment of the facts.

so suppose you go to your doctor and the doctor says, "I just got your lab work back, your cholesterol's a little high."
so_ suppo se_ you_ go_ to_ your_ doct or_ and_ the_ doct or_ say s_ , \ 3 2 ; "_ I_ just_ got_ your_ lab _ work_ back_ , \ 3 2 ;_ your_ cho les ter ol _ '_ s_ a_ little_ high _ ."_

now, you all know that high cholesterol is associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular disease, heart attack, stroke.

and so you're thinking having high cholesterol isn't the best thing, and so the doctor says, "You know, I'd like to give you a drug that will help you lower your cholesterol, a Statin."
and_ so_ you_ '_ re_ thinking_ havi ng_ high _ cho les ter ol _ isn _ '_ t_ the_ bes t_ thing_ , \ 3 2 ;_ and_ so_ the_ doct or_ say s_ , \ 3 2 ; "_ Y ou _ know_ , \ 3 2 ;_ I_ '_ d_ like_ to_ give _ you_ a_ drug _ that_ will_ help_ you_ low er_ your_ cho les ter ol _ , \ 3 2 ;_ a_ S tat in_ ."_

and you've probably heard of statins, you know that they're among the most widely prescribed drugs you probably even know people who take them.
and_ you_ '_ ve_ pro bab ly_ hear d_ of_ stati ns_ , \ 3 2 ;_ you_ know_ that_ they_ '_ re_ am ong _ the_ most_ wi del y_ pres cr ib ed_ drugs_ you_ pro bab ly_ even_ know_ people_ who_ take_ them_ ._

and so you're thinking, "Yeah! give me the Statin."
and_ so_ you_ '_ re_ thinking_ , \ 3 2 ; "_ Y ea h_ ! \ 3 2 ;_ give _ me_ the_ S tat in_ ."_

but there's a question you should ask at this point, a statistic you should ask for that most doctors don't like talking about, and pharmaceutical companies like talking about even less.
but_ there_ '_ s_ a_ question_ you_ should_ ask_ at_ this_ point _ , \ 3 2 ;_ a_ stati stic _ you_ should_ ask_ for_ that_ most_ doct ors _ do n_ '_ t_ like_ tal king_ about_ , \ 3 2 ;_ and_ ph ar ma ce uti cal _ compa ni es_ like_ tal king_ about_ even_ less _ ._

it's for the number needed to treat.

now, what is this, the NNT?

the number should be one.

my doctor wouldn't prescribe something to me if it's not going to help.

but actually, medical practice doesn't work that way.

so the number needed to treat for the most widely prescribed Statin, what do you suppose it is?
so_ the_ number_ need ed_ to_ treat _ for_ the_ most_ wi del y_ pres cr ib ed_ S tat in_ , \ 3 2 ;_ what_ do_ you_ suppo se_ it_ is_ ?_

how many people have to take it before one person is helped?
how_ many_ people_ have_ to_ take_ it_ before_ one_ person _ is_ help ed_ ?_

300.
300_ ._

this is according to research by research practitioners Jerome Groopman and Pamela Hartzband, I ran through the numbers myself.

300 people have to take the drug for a year before one heart attack, stroke or other adverse event is prevented.

now you're probably thinking, "Well, OK, one in 300 chance of lowering my cholesterol.
now_ you_ '_ re_ pro bab ly_ thinking_ , \ 3 2 ; "_ W el l_ , \ 3 2 ;_ O K _ , \ 3 2 ;_ one_ in_ 300_ chan ce_ of_ low ering _ my_ cho les ter ol _ ._

why not, doc? give me the prescription anyway. "
why_ not_ , \ 3 2 ;_ do c_ ? \ 3 2 ;_ give _ me_ the_ pres cr i pt ion_ any way_ . \ 3 2 ; "_

but you should ask at this point for another statistic, and that is, "Tell me about the side effects." right?
but_ you_ should_ ask_ at_ this_ point _ for_ another_ stati stic _ , \ 3 2 ;_ and_ that_ is_ , \ 3 2 ; "_ T el l_ me_ about_ the_ side _ effect s_ . " \ 3 2 ;_ right_ ?_

so for this particular drug, the side effects occur in five percent of the patients.
so_ for_ this_ particular _ drug _ , \ 3 2 ;_ the_ side _ effect s_ oc cur _ in_ five _ percent _ of_ the_ patients _ ._

and they include terrible things -- debilitating muscle and joint pain, gastrointestinal distress -- but now you're thinking, "Five percent, not very likely it's going to happen to me, I'll still take the drug."
and_ they_ inclu de_ terr ible_ things_ \ 3 2 ; - - \ 3 2 ;_ de bil it ati ng_ mus cle _ and_ j oi nt_ pain _ , \ 3 2 ;_ ga str oi nte sti na l_ dist ress _ \ 3 2 ; - - \ 3 2 ;_ but_ now_ you_ '_ re_ thinking_ , \ 3 2 ; "_ F ive_ percent _ , \ 3 2 ;_ not_ very_ like ly_ it_ '_ s_ going_ to_ happen _ to_ me_ , \ 3 2 ;_ I_ '_ ll_ still_ take_ the_ drug _ ."_

but wait a minute.
but_ wa it_ a_ min ut e_ ._

remember under stress you're not thinking clearly.
reme mber _ under_ stre ss_ you_ '_ re_ not_ thinking_ clear ly_ ._

so think about how you're going to work through this ahead of time, so you don't have to manufacture the chain of reasoning on the spot.
so_ think_ about_ how_ you_ '_ re_ going_ to_ work_ through_ this_ ah ea d_ of_ time_ , \ 3 2 ;_ so_ you_ do n_ '_ t_ have_ to_ man u fact ure_ the_ ch ain _ of_ reason ing_ on_ the_ spo t_ ._

300 people take the drug, right? one person's helped, five percent of those 300 have side effects, that's 15 people.
300_ people_ take_ the_ drug _ , \ 3 2 ;_ right_ ? \ 3 2 ;_ one_ person _ '_ s_ help ed_ , \ 3 2 ;_ five _ percent _ of_ those_ 300_ have_ side _ effect s_ , \ 3 2 ;_ that_ '_ s_ 15 _ people_ ._

you're 15 times more likely to be harmed by the drug than you are to be helped by the drug.
you_ '_ re_ 15 _ time s_ more_ like ly_ to_ be_ ha r med_ by_ the_ drug _ than_ you_ are_ to_ be_ help ed_ by_ the_ drug _ ._

now, I'm not saying whether you should take the Statin or not.

I'm just saying you should have this conversation with your doctor.

medical ethics requires it, it's part of the principle of informed consent.
medical_ et hi c s_ re qui res _ it_ , \ 3 2 ;_ it_ '_ s_ part_ of_ the_ pri nc i ple _ of_ inf or med_ cons ent_ ._

you have the right to have access to this kind of information to begin the conversation about whether you want to take the risks or not.

now you might be thinking I've pulled this number out of the air for shock value, but in fact it's rather typical, this number needed to treat.
now_ you_ might_ be_ thinking_ I_ '_ ve_ pu ll ed_ this_ number_ out_ of_ the_ air _ for_ sho ck_ va lu e_ , \ 3 2 ;_ but_ in_ fact _ it_ '_ s_ rat her_ ty pi cal _ , \ 3 2 ;_ this_ number_ need ed_ to_ treat _ ._

for the most widely performed surgery on men over the age of 50, removal of the prostate for cancer, the number needed to treat is 49.
for_ the_ most_ wi del y_ per form ed_ sur ger y_ on_ men _ over_ the_ age_ of_ 50_ , \ 3 2 ;_ re mov al_ of_ the_ pro state _ for_ can cer _ , \ 3 2 ;_ the_ number_ need ed_ to_ treat _ is_ 4 9 _ ._

that's right, 49 surgeries are done for every one person who's helped.
that_ '_ s_ right_ , \ 3 2 ;_ 4 9 _ sur ger ies_ are_ do ne_ for_ every_ one_ person _ who_ '_ s_ help ed_ ._

and the side effects in that case occur in 50 percent of the patients.
and_ the_ side _ effect s_ in_ that_ case _ oc cur _ in_ 50_ percent _ of_ the_ patients _ ._

they include impotence, erectile dysfunction, urinary incontinence, rectal tearing, fecal incontinence.

and if you're lucky, and you're one of the 50 percent who has these, they'll only last for a year or two.

so the idea of the pre-mortem is to think ahead of time to the questions that you might be able to ask that will push the conversation forward.
so_ the_ idea_ of_ the_ pre _ - _ mor tem _ is_ to_ think_ ah ea d_ of_ time_ to_ the_ questions_ that_ you_ might_ be_ able_ to_ ask_ that_ will_ pu sh_ the_ con vers ation_ for ward _ ._

you don't want to have to manufacture all of this on the spot.
you_ do n_ '_ t_ want_ to_ have_ to_ man u fact ure_ all_ of_ this_ on_ the_ spo t_ ._

and you also want to think about things like quality of life.
and_ you_ also_ want_ to_ think_ about_ things_ like_ q ual ity_ of_ life_ ._

because you have a choice oftentimes, do you I want a shorter life that's pain-free, or a longer life that might have a great deal of pain towards the end?
because_ you_ have_ a_ choice _ of tent imes_ , \ 3 2 ;_ do_ you_ I_ want_ a_ sho rt er_ life_ that_ '_ s_ pain _ - _ free _ , \ 3 2 ;_ or_ a_ long er_ life_ that_ might_ have_ a_ gre at_ dea l_ of_ pain _ to ward s_ the_ end _ ?_

these are things to talk about and think about now, with your family and your loved ones.
these_ are_ things_ to_ talk_ about_ and_ think_ about_ now_ , \ 3 2 ;_ with_ your_ fa mil y_ and_ your_ love d_ one s_ ._

you might change your mind in the heat of the moment, but at least you're practiced with this kind of thinking.
you_ might_ change _ your_ min d_ in_ the_ hea t_ of_ the_ mo ment_ , \ 3 2 ;_ but_ at_ lea st_ you_ '_ re_ p rac tic ed_ with_ this_ kind_ of_ thinking_ ._

remember, our brain under stress releases cortisol, and one of the things that happens at that moment is a whole bunch on systems shut down.
reme mber _ , \ 3 2 ;_ our_ brain_ under_ stre ss_ rel eas es_ cor ti sol _ , \ 3 2 ;_ and_ one_ of_ the_ things_ that_ happen s_ at_ that_ mo ment_ is_ a_ who le_ bu nc h_ on_ system s_ s hu t_ down _ ._

there's an evolutionary reason for this.
there_ '_ s_ an_ ev olution ar y_ reason _ for_ this_ ._

face-to-face with a predator, you don't need your digestive system, or your libido, or your immune system, because if you're body is expending metabolism on those things and you don't react quickly, you might become the lion's lunch, and then none of those things matter.

unfortunately, one of the things that goes out the window during those times of stress is rational, logical thinking, as Danny Kahneman and his colleagues have shown.

so we need to train ourselves to think ahead to these kinds of situations.

I think the important point here is recognizing that all of us are flawed.

we all are going to fail now and then.

the idea is to think ahead to what those failures might be, to put systems in place that will help minimize the damage, or to prevent the bad things from happening in the first place.

I'd like to share a little bit about the history of American Sign Language, ASL, plus a bit of my own background. French sign language was brought to America during the early 1800s, and as time went by, mixed with local signs, it evolved into the language we know today as ASL.

"don't slam the door!"
"_ do n_ '_ t_ sl am_ the_ do or_ ! "_

"don't make too much noise when you're eating from the potato-chip bag!"
"_ do n_ '_ t_ make_ too_ much_ no is e_ when_ you_ '_ re_ ea ting_ from_ the_ po tat o_ - _ chi p_ ba g_ ! "_

"don't burp, and when you're eating, make sure you don't scrape your utensils on the plate."
"_ do n_ '_ t_ bu r p_ , \ 3 2 ;_ and_ when_ you_ '_ re_ ea ting_ , \ 3 2 ;_ make_ sur e_ you_ do n_ '_ t_ sc rap e_ your_ ut en sil s_ on_ the_ pl ate_ ."_

all of these things I term "sound etiquette."
all_ of_ these_ things_ I_ ter m_ \ 3 2 ; "_ sound_ eti que tte _ ."_

maybe I think about sound etiquette more than the average hearing person does.
maybe_ I_ think_ about_ sound_ eti que tte _ more_ than_ the_ a ver age_ hear ing_ person _ does _ ._

I'm hyper-vigilant around sound.
I_ '_ m_ hy per _ - _ vi gi lan t_ around_ sound_ ._

and I'm always waiting in eager nervous anticipation around sound, about what's to come next.
and_ I_ '_ m_ always_ wa iti ng_ in_ ea ger _ ner vo us_ ant ici pat ion_ around_ sound_ , \ 3 2 ;_ about_ what_ '_ s_ to_ come_ next_ ._

hence, this drawing.

and you notice the staff -- there are no notes contained in the lines.
and_ you_ noti ce_ the_ sta ff _ \ 3 2 ; - - \ 3 2 ;_ there_ are_ no_ not es_ conta ine d_ in_ the_ line s_ ._

that's because the lines already contain sound through the subtle smudges and smears.
that_ '_ s_ because_ the_ line s_ al read y_ conta in_ sound_ through_ the_ su b tl e_ sm ud ge s_ and_ sm ear s_ ._

in Deaf culture, movement is equivalent to sound.
in_ D ea f_ culture _ , \ 3 2 ;_ mov em ent_ is_ equ i va len t_ to_ sound_ ._

this is a sign for "staff" in ASL.
this_ is_ a_ sign_ for_ \ 3 2 ; "_ sta ff _ " \ 3 2 ;_ in_ ASL_ ._

doesn't feel natural.
does n_ '_ t_ feel_ na tur al_ ._

that's why you'll notice in my drawings, I stick to four lines on paper.
that_ '_ s_ why_ you_ '_ ll_ noti ce_ in_ my_ draw ing s_ , \ 3 2 ;_ I_ stic k_ to_ four_ line s_ on_ paper _ ._

in the year 2008, I had the opportunity to travel to Berlin, Germany, for an artist residency there.
in_ the_ year_ 200 8_ , \ 3 2 ;_ I_ had_ the_ op port uni ty_ to_ tra vel _ to_ B er lin _ , \ 3 2 ;_ G erm any_ , \ 3 2 ;_ for_ an_ art ist _ resi den cy _ there_ ._

prior to this time, I had been working as a painter.
pri or_ to_ this_ time_ , \ 3 2 ;_ I_ had_ been_ work ing_ as_ a_ pain ter _ ._

during this summer, I visited different museums and gallery spaces, and as I went from one place to the next, I noticed there was no visual art there.
du ring_ this_ su mm er_ , \ 3 2 ;_ I_ vis ite d_ different_ mus e um s_ and_ ga ll er y_ spa ces _ , \ 3 2 ;_ and_ as_ I_ we nt_ from_ one_ place_ to_ the_ next_ , \ 3 2 ;_ I_ noti ce d_ there_ was_ no_ visual _ art _ there_ ._

at that time, sound was trending, and this struck me...
at_ that_ time_ , \ 3 2 ;_ sound_ was_ tr end ing_ , \ 3 2 ;_ and_ this_ str uc k_ me_ ... _

there was no visual art, everything was auditory.
there_ was_ no_ visual _ art _ , \ 3 2 ;_ everything_ was_ a ud it ory _ ._

now sound has come into my art territory.
now_ sound_ has_ come_ into_ my_ art _ terr it ory _ ._

is it going to further distance me from art?
is_ it_ going_ to_ fu rt her_ dist ance_ me_ from_ art _ ?_

I realized that doesn't have to be the case at all.
I_ realized _ that_ does n_ '_ t_ have_ to_ be_ the_ case _ at_ all_ ._

I actually know sound.
I_ act ually_ know_ sound_ ._

I know it so well that it doesn't have to be something just experienced through the ears.
I_ know_ it_ so_ well _ that_ it_ does n_ '_ t_ have_ to_ be_ something_ just_ experience d_ through_ the_ ear s_ ._

it could be felt tactually, or experienced as a visual, And everything that I had been taught regarding sound, I decided to do away with and unlearn.
it_ could_ be_ fe lt _ ta ct ually_ , \ 3 2 ;_ or_ experience d_ as_ a_ visual _ , \ 3 2 ;_ A nd_ everything_ that_ I_ had_ been_ ta ugh t_ re ga rd ing_ sound_ , \ 3 2 ;_ I_ deci ded _ to_ do_ away_ with_ and_ un learn _ ._

I started creating a new body of work.
I_ started_ creati ng_ a_ new_ body_ of_ work_ ._

and when I presented this to the art community, I was blown away with the amount of support and attention I received.
and_ when_ I_ pres ent ed_ this_ to_ the_ art _ communi ty_ , \ 3 2 ;_ I_ was_ blo w n_ away_ with_ the_ am ou nt_ of_ suppo rt_ and_ att enti on_ I_ rec ei ved_ ._

I realized: power, control -- social currency.
I_ realized _ : \ 3 2 ;_ power_ , \ 3 2 ;_ contr ol _ \ 3 2 ; - - \ 3 2 ;_ social_ curren cy _ ._

in the back of my mind, I've always felt that sound was your thing, a hearing person's thing.
in_ the_ back_ of_ my_ min d_ , \ 3 2 ;_ I_ '_ ve_ always_ fe lt _ that_ sound_ was_ your_ thing_ , \ 3 2 ;_ a_ hear ing_ person _ '_ s_ thing_ ._

and sound is so powerful that it could either disempower me and my artwork, or it could empower me.
and_ sound_ is_ so_ power ful_ that_ it_ could_ ei ther_ dis em power_ me_ and_ my_ art work_ , \ 3 2 ;_ or_ it_ could_ em power_ me_ ._

I chose to be empowered.
I_ cho se_ to_ be_ em power ed_ ._

there's a massive culture around spoken language.
there_ '_ s_ a_ mas si ve_ culture _ around_ spo ke n_ lang ua ge_ ._

and just because I don't use my literal voice to communicate, in society's eyes it's as if I don't have a voice at all.
and_ just_ because_ I_ do n_ '_ t_ use _ my_ lit er al_ voice _ to_ communi cat e_ , \ 3 2 ;_ in_ soci et y_ '_ s_ ey es_ it_ '_ s_ as_ if_ I_ do n_ '_ t_ have_ a_ voice _ at_ all_ ._

so I need to work with individuals who can support me as an equal and become my voice.
so_ I_ need_ to_ work_ with_ ind ivi du al s_ who_ can_ suppo rt_ me_ as_ an_ equ al_ and_ become_ my_ voice _ ._

and that way, I'm able to maintain relevancy in society today.
and_ that_ way_ , \ 3 2 ;_ I_ '_ m_ able_ to_ main tain_ rel ev anc y_ in_ soci et y_ today_ ._

so at school, at work and institutions, I work with many different ASL interpreters.
so_ at_ sc hoo l_ , \ 3 2 ;_ at_ work_ and_ ins ti tu tion s_ , \ 3 2 ;_ I_ work_ with_ many_ different_ ASL_ inter pre ter s_ ._

and their voice becomes my voice and identity.
and_ their_ voice _ bec ome s_ my_ voice _ and_ ident ity_ ._

they help me to be heard.
they_ help_ me_ to_ be_ hear d_ ._

and their voices hold value and currency.
and_ their_ voice s_ hold _ va lu e_ and_ curren cy _ ._

ironically, by borrowing out their voices, I'm able to maintain a temporary form of currency, kind of like taking out a loan with a very high interest rate.
ir on ically_ , \ 3 2 ;_ by_ bor ro wi ng_ out_ their_ voice s_ , \ 3 2 ;_ I_ '_ m_ able_ to_ main tain_ a_ tem po rar y_ form_ of_ curren cy _ , \ 3 2 ;_ kind_ of_ like_ tak ing_ out_ a_ lo an_ with_ a_ very_ high _ inter est_ rat e_ ._

if I didn't continue this practice, I feel that I could just fade off into oblivion and not maintain any form of social currency.
if_ I_ di d n_ '_ t_ continu e_ this_ p rac tic e_ , \ 3 2 ;_ I_ feel_ that_ I_ could_ just_ fa de_ off _ into_ ob livi on_ and_ not_ main tain_ any_ form_ of_ social_ curren cy _ ._

so with sound as my new art medium, I delved into the world of music.
so_ with_ sound_ as_ my_ new_ art _ medi um _ , \ 3 2 ;_ I_ del ved_ into_ the_ world_ of_ music _ ._

and I was surprised to see the similarities between music and ASL.
and_ I_ was_ sur pri sed _ to_ see_ the_ si mil ar iti es_ between_ music _ and_ ASL_ ._

for example, a musical note cannot be fully captured and expressed on paper.
for_ ex am ple _ , \ 3 2 ;_ a_ music al_ not e_ can not_ be_ ful ly_ ca pt ure d_ and_ exp ress ed_ on_ paper _ ._

and the same holds true for a concept in ASL.
and_ the_ same_ hold s_ true _ for_ a_ con ce pt _ in_ ASL_ ._

they're both highly spatial and highly inflected -- meaning that subtle changes can affect the entire meaning of both signs and sounds.
they_ '_ re_ bot h_ high ly_ spa ti al_ and_ high ly_ inf lec ted _ \ 3 2 ; - - \ 3 2 ;_ mean ing_ that_ su b tl e_ change s_ can_ aff ect _ the_ entire _ mean ing_ of_ bot h_ si gn s_ and_ sound s_ ._

I'd like to share with you a piano metaphor, to have you have a better understanding of how ASL works.
I_ '_ d_ like_ to_ sha re_ with_ you_ a_ pi an o_ met ap ho r_ , \ 3 2 ;_ to_ have_ you_ have_ a_ better_ under stand ing_ of_ how_ ASL_ work s_ ._

so, envision a piano.
so_ , \ 3 2 ;_ en vis ion_ a_ pi an o_ ._

ASL is broken down into many different grammatical parameters.
ASL_ is_ bro ke n_ down _ into_ many_ different_ gra mm ati cal _ pa ra met ers_ ._

if you assign a different parameter to each finger as you play the piano -- such as facial expression, body movement, speed, hand shape and so on, as you play the piano -- English is a linear language, as if one key is being pressed at a time.
if_ you_ as sign_ a_ different_ pa ra met er_ to_ each_ fin ger _ as_ you_ play _ the_ pi an o_ \ 3 2 ; - - \ 3 2 ;_ such_ as_ fa ci al_ exp ress ion_ , \ 3 2 ;_ body_ mov em ent_ , \ 3 2 ;_ spe ed_ , \ 3 2 ;_ hand _ sha pe_ and_ so_ on_ , \ 3 2 ;_ as_ you_ play _ the_ pi an o_ \ 3 2 ; - - \ 3 2 ;_ E ngl ish _ is_ a_ line ar_ lang ua ge_ , \ 3 2 ;_ as_ if_ one_ ke y_ is_ being_ pres sed _ at_ a_ time_ ._

however, ASL is more like a chord -- all 10 fingers need to come down simultaneously to express a clear concept or idea in ASL.
ho we ver _ , \ 3 2 ;_ ASL_ is_ more_ like_ a_ cho rd _ \ 3 2 ; - - \ 3 2 ;_ all_ 10_ fin ger s_ need_ to_ come_ down _ si mul ta ne ou sl y_ to_ exp ress _ a_ clear _ con ce pt _ or_ idea_ in_ ASL_ ._

if just one of those keys were to change the chord, it would create a completely different meaning.
if_ just_ one_ of_ those_ ke ys_ were_ to_ change _ the_ cho rd _ , \ 3 2 ;_ it_ would_ create_ a_ comp let el y_ different_ mean ing_ ._

the same applies to music in regards to pitch, tone and volume.
the_ same_ app lie s_ to_ music _ in_ re ga rd s_ to_ pi t ch_ , \ 3 2 ;_ to ne_ and_ vo lu me_ ._

in ASL, by playing around with these different grammatical parameters, you can express different ideas.
in_ ASL_ , \ 3 2 ;_ by_ play ing_ around_ with_ these_ different_ gra mm ati cal _ pa ra met ers_ , \ 3 2 ;_ you_ can_ exp ress _ different_ idea s_ ._

for example, take the sign TO-LOOK-AT.
for_ ex am ple _ , \ 3 2 ;_ take_ the_ sign_ T O _ - _ L O O K _ - _ A T _ ._

this is the sign TO-LOOK-AT.
this_ is_ the_ sign_ T O _ - _ L O O K _ - _ A T _ ._

I'm looking at you.
I_ '_ m_ look ing_ at_ you_ ._

staring at you.
star ing_ at_ you_ ._

Oh -- busted.
O h_ \ 3 2 ; - - \ 3 2 ;_ bu ste d_ ._

uh-oh.
u h_ - _ o h_ ._

what are you looking at?
what_ are_ you_ look ing_ at_ ?_

Aw, stop.
A w_ , \ 3 2 ;_ sto p_ ._

I then started thinking, "What if I was to look at ASL through a musical lens?"
I_ then_ started_ thinking_ , \ 3 2 ; "_ W hat _ if_ I_ was_ to_ look_ at_ ASL_ through_ a_ music al_ len s_ ?"_

if I was to create a sign and repeat it over and over, it could become like a piece of visual music.
if_ I_ was_ to_ create_ a_ sign_ and_ rep ea t_ it_ over_ and_ over_ , \ 3 2 ;_ it_ could_ become_ like_ a_ piece _ of_ visual _ music _ ._

for example, this is the sign for "day," as the sun rises and sets.
for_ ex am ple _ , \ 3 2 ;_ this_ is_ the_ sign_ for_ \ 3 2 ; "_ day _ , " \ 3 2 ;_ as_ the_ su n_ ris es_ and_ set s_ ._

this is "all day."
this_ is_ \ 3 2 ; "_ all_ day _ ."_

if I was to repeat it and slow it down, visually it looks like a piece of music.
if_ I_ was_ to_ rep ea t_ it_ and_ sl ow _ it_ down _ , \ 3 2 ;_ visual ly_ it_ look s_ like_ a_ piece _ of_ music _ ._

all... day.
all_ ... \ 3 2 ;_ day _ ._

I feel the same holds true for "all night."
I_ feel_ the_ same_ hold s_ true _ for_ \ 3 2 ; "_ all_ night_ ."_

"all night."
"_ all_ night_ ."_

this is all-night, represented in this drawing.
this_ is_ all_ - _ night_ , \ 3 2 ;_ repr es ent ed_ in_ this_ draw ing_ ._

and this led me to thinking about three different kinds of nights: "last night," "overnight," "all night long."
and_ this_ led _ me_ to_ thinking_ about_ three_ different_ ki nds _ of_ ni ght s_ : \ 3 2 ; "_ last_ night_ , " \ 3 2 ; "_ ov er night_ , " \ 3 2 ; "_ all_ night_ long _ ."_

I feel like the third one has a lot more musicality than the other two.
I_ feel_ like_ the_ th ird_ one_ has_ a_ lot_ more_ music ality _ than_ the_ other_ two_ ._

this represents how time is expressed in ASL and how the distance from your body can express the changes in time.
this_ repr es ent s_ how_ time_ is_ exp ress ed_ in_ ASL_ and_ how_ the_ dist ance_ from_ your_ body_ can_ exp ress _ the_ change s_ in_ time_ ._

for example, 1H is one hand, 2H is two hand, present tense happens closest and in front of the body, future is in front of the body and the past is to your back.
for_ ex am ple _ , \ 3 2 ;_ 1 H _ is_ one_ hand _ , \ 3 2 ;_ 2 H _ is_ two_ hand _ , \ 3 2 ;_ pres ent_ ten se_ happen s_ close st_ and_ in_ front_ of_ the_ body_ , \ 3 2 ;_ fu ture _ is_ in_ front_ of_ the_ body_ and_ the_ past_ is_ to_ your_ back_ ._

so, the first example is "a long time ago."
so_ , \ 3 2 ;_ the_ first_ ex am ple _ is_ \ 3 2 ; "_ a_ long _ time_ ago _ ."_

then "past," "used to" and the last one, which is my favorite, with the very romantic and dramatic notion to it, "once upon a time."
then_ \ 3 2 ; "_ past_ , " \ 3 2 ; "_ used_ to_ " \ 3 2 ;_ and_ the_ last_ one_ , \ 3 2 ;_ which_ is_ my_ fa vo rit e_ , \ 3 2 ;_ with_ the_ very_ romantic_ and_ dr am ati c_ noti on_ to_ it_ , \ 3 2 ; "_ on ce_ up on_ a_ time_ ."_

"common time" with a specific time signature of four beats per measure.
"_ comm on_ time_ " \ 3 2 ;_ with_ a_ speci fi c_ time_ si gn ature _ of_ four_ bea ts_ per _ meas ure_ ._

yet when I see the word "common time," what automatically comes to mind for me is "at the same time."
ye t_ when_ I_ see_ the_ wor d_ \ 3 2 ; "_ comm on_ time_ , " \ 3 2 ;_ what_ aut om ati call y_ com es_ to_ min d_ for_ me_ is_ \ 3 2 ; "_ at_ the_ same_ time_ ."_

so notice RH: right hand, LH: left hand.
so_ noti ce_ R H _ : \ 3 2 ;_ right_ hand _ , \ 3 2 ;_ L H _ : \ 3 2 ;_ le ft _ hand _ ._

we have the staff across the head and the chest.
we_ have_ the_ sta ff _ across_ the_ head _ and_ the_ ches t_ ._

[head: RH, Flash claw] [Common time] [chest: LH, Flash claw] I'm now going to demonstrate a hand shape called the "flash claw."
[ _ head _ : \ 3 2 ;_ R H _ , \ 3 2 ;_ F las h_ cla w_ ] \ 3 2 ; [ _ C om mon _ time_ ] \ 3 2 ; [ _ ches t_ : \ 3 2 ;_ L H _ , \ 3 2 ;_ F las h_ cla w_ ] \ 3 2 ;_ I_ '_ m_ now_ going_ to_ dem ons tra te_ a_ hand _ sha pe_ called_ the_ \ 3 2 ; "_ fl as h_ cla w_ ."_

can you please follow along with me?
can_ you_ ple ase _ fol low _ alon g_ with_ me_ ?_

everybody, hands up.
ever y body_ , \ 3 2 ;_ hand s_ up_ ._

now we're going to do it in both the head and the chest, kind of like "common time" or at the same time.
now_ we_ '_ re_ going_ to_ do_ it_ in_ bot h_ the_ head _ and_ the_ ches t_ , \ 3 2 ;_ kind_ of_ like_ \ 3 2 ; "_ comm on_ time_ " \ 3 2 ;_ or_ at_ the_ same_ time_ ._

yes, got it.
ye s_ , \ 3 2 ;_ got_ it_ ._

that means "to fall in love" in International [Sign].
that_ mean s_ \ 3 2 ; "_ to_ fall _ in_ love_ " \ 3 2 ;_ in_ I nte rna tion al_ \ 3 2 ; [ _ S ig n_ ] ._

international [Sign], as a note, is a visual tool to help communicate across cultures and sign languages around the world.
inter na tion al_ \ 3 2 ; [ _ S ig n_ ] , \ 3 2 ;_ as_ a_ not e_ , \ 3 2 ;_ is_ a_ visual _ too l_ to_ help_ communi cat e_ across_ culture s_ and_ sign_ lang ua ge s_ around_ the_ world_ ._

the second one I'd like to demonstrate is this -- please follow along with me again.
the_ second _ one_ I_ '_ d_ like_ to_ dem ons tra te_ is_ this_ \ 3 2 ; - - \ 3 2 ;_ ple ase _ fol low _ alon g_ with_ me_ again _ ._

and now this.
and_ now_ this_ ._

this is "colonization" in ASL.
this_ is_ \ 3 2 ; "_ colo ni z ation_ " \ 3 2 ;_ in_ ASL_ ._

now the third -- please follow along again.
now_ the_ th ird_ \ 3 2 ; - - \ 3 2 ;_ ple ase _ fol low _ alon g_ again _ ._

and again.
and_ again _ ._

this is "enlightenment" in ASL.
this_ is_ \ 3 2 ; "_ en light en ment_ " \ 3 2 ;_ in_ ASL_ ._

so let's do all three together.
so_ let _ '_ s_ do_ all_ three_ together_ ._

"fall in love," "colonization" and "enlightenment."
"_ fall _ in_ love_ , " \ 3 2 ; "_ colo ni z ation_ " \ 3 2 ;_ and_ \ 3 2 ; "_ en light en ment_ ."_

good job, everyone.
good_ j ob _ , \ 3 2 ;_ ever yon e_ ._

notice how all three signs are very similar, they all happen at the head and the chest, but they convey quite different meanings.
noti ce_ how_ all_ three_ si gn s_ are_ very_ si mil ar_ , \ 3 2 ;_ they_ all_ happen _ at_ the_ head _ and_ the_ ches t_ , \ 3 2 ;_ but_ they_ con ve y_ qui te_ different_ mean ing s_ ._

so it's amazing to see how ASL is alive and thriving, just like music is.
so_ it_ '_ s_ am azin g_ to_ see_ how_ ASL_ is_ ali ve_ and_ thr ivi ng_ , \ 3 2 ;_ just_ like_ music _ is_ ._

however, in this day and age, we live in a very audio-centric world.
ho we ver _ , \ 3 2 ;_ in_ this_ day _ and_ age_ , \ 3 2 ;_ we_ live_ in_ a_ very_ a ud io _ - _ cent ri c_ world_ ._

and just because ASL has no sound to it, it automatically holds no social currency.
and_ just_ because_ ASL_ has_ no_ sound_ to_ it_ , \ 3 2 ;_ it_ aut om ati call y_ hold s_ no_ social_ curren cy _ ._

we need to start thinking harder about what defines social currency and allow ASL to develop its own form of currency -- without sound.
we_ need_ to_ start _ thinking_ hard er_ about_ what_ def ine s_ social_ curren cy _ and_ allow _ ASL_ to_ de vel op _ its_ own_ form_ of_ curren cy _ \ 3 2 ; - - \ 3 2 ;_ without_ sound_ ._

and this could possibly be a step to lead to a more inclusive society.
and_ this_ could_ possib ly_ be_ a_ step_ to_ lea d_ to_ a_ more_ inclu si ve_ soci et y_ ._

and maybe people will understand that you don't need to be deaf to learn ASL, nor do you have to be hearing to learn music.
and_ maybe_ people_ will_ understand_ that_ you_ do n_ '_ t_ need_ to_ be_ dea f_ to_ learn _ ASL_ , \ 3 2 ;_ nor _ do_ you_ have_ to_ be_ hear ing_ to_ learn _ music _ ._

ASL is such a rich treasure that I'd like you to have the same experience.
ASL_ is_ such_ a_ ri ch_ tr eas ure_ that_ I_ '_ d_ like_ you_ to_ have_ the_ same_ experience _ ._

and I'd like to invite you to open your ears, to open your eyes, take part in our culture and experience our visual language.
and_ I_ '_ d_ like_ to_ inv ite _ you_ to_ ope n_ your_ ear s_ , \ 3 2 ;_ to_ ope n_ your_ ey es_ , \ 3 2 ;_ take_ part_ in_ our_ culture _ and_ experience _ our_ visual _ lang ua ge_ ._

and you never know, you might just fall in love with us.
and_ you_ never_ know_ , \ 3 2 ;_ you_ might_ just_ fall _ in_ love_ with_ us_ ._

thank you.
thank_ you_ ._

Denise Kahler-Braaten: Hey, that's me.

when I was a kid, my parents would tell me, "You can make a mess, but you have to clean up after yourself."
when_ I_ was_ a_ ki d_ , \ 3 2 ;_ my_ parents_ would_ tell_ me_ , \ 3 2 ; "_ Y ou _ can_ make_ a_ mes s_ , \ 3 2 ;_ but_ you_ have_ to_ cle an_ up_ after_ you rsel f_ ."_

so I grew up in a bubble of innocence -- or a bubble of ignorance, I should say, because adults would lie to us to protect us from the ugly truth.

and growing up, I found out that adults make a mess, and they're not very good at cleaning up after themselves.

and so it's sad to say, but today more than 80 percent of the oceans have plastic in them.

it's a horrifying fact.
it_ '_ s_ a_ ho rr ify ing_ fact _ ._

and in past decades, we've been taking those big ships out and those big nets, and we collect those plastic bits that we look at under a microscope, and we sort them, and then we put this data onto a map.

but that takes forever, it's very expensive, and so it's quite risky to take those big boats out.
but_ that_ tak es_ fore ver _ , \ 3 2 ;_ it_ '_ s_ very_ expe ns ive_ , \ 3 2 ;_ and_ so_ it_ '_ s_ qui te_ ris k y_ to_ take_ those_ bi g_ bo at s_ out_ ._

so with my students, ages six to 15, we've been dreaming of inventing a better way.
so_ with_ my_ students _ , \ 3 2 ;_ age s_ si x _ to_ 15 _ , \ 3 2 ;_ we_ '_ ve_ been_ dr ea min g_ of_ invent ing_ a_ better_ way_ ._

so we've transformed our tiny Hong Kong classroom into a workshop.
so_ we_ '_ ve_ trans form ed_ our_ tin y_ Ho ng_ K ong _ cla ss ro om _ into_ a_ work sho p_ ._

and so we started building this small workbench, with different heights, so even really short kids can participate.
and_ so_ we_ started_ build ing_ this_ small_ work be nc h_ , \ 3 2 ;_ with_ different_ he ight s_ , \ 3 2 ;_ so_ even_ really_ sho rt_ kids_ can_ part ici pat e_ ._

and let me tell you, kids with power tools are awesome and safe.
and_ let _ me_ tell_ you_ , \ 3 2 ;_ kids_ with_ power_ too ls _ are_ aw es ome _ and_ sa fe _ ._

not really.
not_ really_ ._

and so, back to plastic.
and_ so_ , \ 3 2 ;_ back_ to_ plastic _ ._

we collect this plastic and we grind it to the size we find it in the ocean, which is very small because it breaks down.
we_ colle ct_ this_ plastic _ and_ we_ gr ind _ it_ to_ the_ si ze _ we_ find_ it_ in_ the_ ocean _ , \ 3 2 ;_ which_ is_ very_ small_ because_ it_ brea ks _ down _ ._

and so this is how we work.
and_ so_ this_ is_ how_ we_ work_ ._

I let the imaginations of my students run wild.
I_ let _ the_ imagin ation s_ of_ my_ students _ ru n_ wi ld _ ._

and my job is to try to collect the best of each kid's idea and try to combine it into something that hopefully would work.
and_ my_ j ob _ is_ to_ try_ to_ colle ct_ the_ bes t_ of_ each_ ki d_ '_ s_ idea_ and_ try_ to_ combin e_ it_ into_ something_ that_ hope ful ly_ would_ work_ ._

and so we have agreed that instead of collecting plastic bits, we are going to collect only the data.
and_ so_ we_ have_ ag re ed_ that_ instead _ of_ colle cti ng_ plastic _ bit s_ , \ 3 2 ;_ we_ are_ going_ to_ colle ct_ only_ the_ da ta _ ._

so we're going to get an image of the plastic with a robot -- so robots, kids get very excited.
so_ we_ '_ re_ going_ to_ get_ an_ im age_ of_ the_ plastic _ with_ a_ robot _ \ 3 2 ; - - \ 3 2 ;_ so_ robot s_ , \ 3 2 ;_ kids_ get_ very_ ex ci ted _ ._

and the next thing we do -- we do what we call "rapid prototyping."
and_ the_ next_ thing_ we_ do_ \ 3 2 ; - - \ 3 2 ;_ we_ do_ what_ we_ call_ \ 3 2 ; "_ rap i d_ prot ot y pi ng_ ."_

we are so rapid at prototyping that the lunch is still in the lunchbox when we're hacking it.
we_ are_ so_ rap i d_ at_ prot ot y pi ng_ that_ the_ lu nc h_ is_ still_ in_ the_ lu nc h box_ when_ we_ '_ re_ ha ck ing_ it_ ._

and we hack table lamps and webcams, into plumbing fixtures and we assemble that into a floating robot that will be slowly moving through water and this is the image that we get in the robot.
and_ we_ ha ck_ table _ la mp s_ and_ we b ca ms_ , \ 3 2 ;_ into_ pl um bi ng_ fi xt ure s_ and_ we_ asse mbl e_ that_ into_ a_ fl o ati ng_ robot _ that_ will_ be_ sl ow ly_ mov ing_ through_ water _ and_ this_ is_ the_ im age_ that_ we_ get_ in_ the_ robot _ ._

so we see the plastic pieces floating slowly through the sensor, and the computer on board will process this image, and measure the size of each particle, so we have a rough estimate of how much plastic there is in the water.
so_ we_ see_ the_ plastic _ piece s_ fl o ati ng_ sl ow ly_ through_ the_ sens or_ , \ 3 2 ;_ and_ the_ comp ut er_ on_ bo ar d_ will_ process _ this_ im age_ , \ 3 2 ;_ and_ meas ure_ the_ si ze _ of_ each_ part ic le_ , \ 3 2 ;_ so_ we_ have_ a_ ro ugh _ esti mat e_ of_ how_ much_ plastic _ there_ is_ in_ the_ water _ ._

so we documented this invention step by step on a website for inventors called Instructables, in the hope that somebody would make it even better.
so_ we_ do c um ent ed_ this_ invent ion_ step_ by_ step_ on_ a_ we b site _ for_ invent ors _ called_ I ns tru ct abl es_ , \ 3 2 ;_ in_ the_ hope _ that_ some body_ would_ make_ it_ even_ better_ ._

what was really cool about this project was that the students saw a local problem, and boom -- they are trying to immediately address it.
what_ was_ really_ coo l_ about_ this_ project _ was_ that_ the_ students _ sa w_ a_ loca l_ problem _ , \ 3 2 ;_ and_ bo om _ \ 3 2 ; - - \ 3 2 ;_ they_ are_ try ing_ to_ im medi ate ly_ add ress _ it_ ._

[I can investigate my local problem] But my students in Hong Kong are hyperconnected kids.
[ _ I_ can_ inv esti ga te_ my_ loca l_ problem _ ] \ 3 2 ;_ B ut _ my_ students _ in_ Ho ng_ K ong _ are_ hy per con ne cte d_ kids_ ._

and they watch the news, they watch the Internet, and they came across this image.
and_ they_ wa t ch_ the_ ne w s_ , \ 3 2 ;_ they_ wa t ch_ the_ I nte r ne t_ , \ 3 2 ;_ and_ they_ came_ across_ this_ im age_ ._

this was a child, probably under 10, cleaning up an oil spill bare-handed, in the Sundarbans, which is the world's largest mangrove forest in Bangladesh.
this_ was_ a_ child _ , \ 3 2 ;_ pro bab ly_ under_ 10_ , \ 3 2 ;_ cle an ing_ up_ an_ oi l_ spi ll_ ba re_ - _ hand ed_ , \ 3 2 ;_ in_ the_ S und ar ba ns_ , \ 3 2 ;_ which_ is_ the_ world_ '_ s_ large st_ man gr ov e_ fore st_ in_ Ba ngl ade sh_ ._

so they were very shocked, because this is the water they drink, this is the water they bathe in, this is the water they fish in -- this is the place where they live.
so_ they_ were_ very_ sho ck ed_ , \ 3 2 ;_ because_ this_ is_ the_ water _ they_ dri nk _ , \ 3 2 ;_ this_ is_ the_ water _ they_ ba the_ in_ , \ 3 2 ;_ this_ is_ the_ water _ they_ fi sh_ in_ \ 3 2 ; - - \ 3 2 ;_ this_ is_ the_ place_ where_ they_ live_ ._

and also you can see the water is brown, the mud is brown and oil is brown, so when everything is mixed up, it's really hard to see what's in the water.
and_ also_ you_ can_ see_ the_ water _ is_ bro w n_ , \ 3 2 ;_ the_ m ud _ is_ bro w n_ and_ oi l_ is_ bro w n_ , \ 3 2 ;_ so_ when_ everything_ is_ mi x ed_ up_ , \ 3 2 ;_ it_ '_ s_ really_ hard _ to_ see_ what_ '_ s_ in_ the_ water _ ._

but, there's a technology that's rather simple, that's called spectrometry, that allows you see what's in the water.
but_ , \ 3 2 ;_ there_ '_ s_ a_ tec hn ol og y_ that_ '_ s_ rat her_ simpl e_ , \ 3 2 ;_ that_ '_ s_ called_ spec tr ome try_ , \ 3 2 ;_ that_ allow s_ you_ see_ what_ '_ s_ in_ the_ water _ ._

so we built a rough prototype of a spectrometer, and you can shine light through different substances that produce different spectrums, so that can help you identify what's in the water.
so_ we_ built _ a_ ro ugh _ prot ot y pe_ of_ a_ spec tr ome ter _ , \ 3 2 ;_ and_ you_ can_ shi ne_ light _ through_ different_ su b sta nce s_ that_ produce _ different_ spec tru ms_ , \ 3 2 ;_ so_ that_ can_ help_ you_ ident ify _ what_ '_ s_ in_ the_ water _ ._

so we packed this prototype of a sensor, and we shipped it to Bangladesh.
so_ we_ pa ck ed_ this_ prot ot y pe_ of_ a_ sens or_ , \ 3 2 ;_ and_ we_ shi pp ed_ it_ to_ Ba ngl ade sh_ ._

so what was cool about this project was that beyond addressing a local problem, or looking at a local problem, my students used their empathy and their sense of being creative to help, remotely, other kids.
so_ what_ was_ coo l_ about_ this_ project _ was_ that_ be yon d_ add ress ing_ a_ loca l_ problem _ , \ 3 2 ;_ or_ look ing_ at_ a_ loca l_ problem _ , \ 3 2 ;_ my_ students _ used_ their_ em pat hy _ and_ their_ sens e_ of_ being_ creati ve_ to_ help_ , \ 3 2 ;_ re mot el y_ , \ 3 2 ;_ other_ kids_ ._

[I can investigate a remote problem] So I was very compelled by doing the second experiments, and I wanted to take it even further -- maybe addressing an even harder problem, and it's also closer to my heart.
[ _ I_ can_ inv esti ga te_ a_ re mot e_ problem _ ] \ 3 2 ;_ S o_ I_ was_ very_ comp el led _ by_ do ing_ the_ second _ expe ri ment s_ , \ 3 2 ;_ and_ I_ want ed_ to_ take_ it_ even_ fu rt her_ \ 3 2 ; - - \ 3 2 ;_ maybe_ add ress ing_ an_ even_ hard er_ problem _ , \ 3 2 ;_ and_ it_ '_ s_ also_ close r_ to_ my_ hear t_ ._

so I'm half Japanese and half French, and maybe you remember in 2011 there was a massive earthquake in Japan.
so_ I_ '_ m_ ha lf _ J ap an es e_ and_ ha lf _ F ren ch_ , \ 3 2 ;_ and_ maybe_ you_ reme mber _ in_ 20 11 _ there_ was_ a_ mas si ve_ ear th q ua ke_ in_ J ap an_ ._

it was so violent that it triggered several giant waves -- they are called tsunami -- and those tsunami destroyed many cities on the eastern coast of Japan.
it_ was_ so_ violen t_ that_ it_ tri gg er ed_ se ver al_ gi ant _ wa ves_ \ 3 2 ; - - \ 3 2 ;_ they_ are_ called_ t su na mi _ \ 3 2 ; - - \ 3 2 ;_ and_ those_ t su na mi _ des tr o ye d_ many_ ci ties _ on_ the_ eas ter n_ co ast _ of_ J ap an_ ._

more than 14,000 people died in an instant.
more_ than_ 1 4_ ,_ 0 0 0_ people_ die d_ in_ an_ ins ta nt_ ._

also, it damaged the nuclear power plant of Fukushima, the nuclear power plant just by the water.
also_ , \ 3 2 ;_ it_ da mag ed_ the_ nu clear _ power_ plan t_ of_ F u k us hi ma _ , \ 3 2 ;_ the_ nu clear _ power_ plan t_ just_ by_ the_ water _ ._

and today, I read the reports and an average of 300 tons are leaking from the nuclear power plant into the Pacific Ocean.
and_ today_ , \ 3 2 ;_ I_ read _ the_ rep ort s_ and_ an_ a ver age_ of_ 300_ to ns_ are_ lea king_ from_ the_ nu clear _ power_ plan t_ into_ the_ P ac i fi c_ O ce an_ ._

and today the whole Pacific Ocean has traces of contamination of cesium-137.
and_ today_ the_ who le_ P ac i fi c_ O ce an_ has_ tra ces _ of_ conta min ation_ of_ ces i um _ - _ 1 3 7 _ ._

if you go outside on the West Coast, you can measure Fukushima everywhere.
if_ you_ go_ out side _ on_ the_ W est_ C o ast _ , \ 3 2 ;_ you_ can_ meas ure_ F u k us hi ma _ ever y where_ ._

but if you look at the map, it can look like most of the radioactivity has been washed away from the Japanese coast, and most of it is now -- it looks like it's safe, it's blue.
but_ if_ you_ look_ at_ the_ ma p_ , \ 3 2 ;_ it_ can_ look_ like_ most_ of_ the_ radio act ivi ty_ has_ been_ wa she d_ away_ from_ the_ J ap an es e_ co ast _ , \ 3 2 ;_ and_ most_ of_ it_ is_ now_ \ 3 2 ; - - \ 3 2 ;_ it_ look s_ like_ it_ '_ s_ sa fe _ , \ 3 2 ;_ it_ '_ s_ bl ue _ ._

well, reality is a bit more complicated than this.
well _ , \ 3 2 ;_ real ity_ is_ a_ bit_ more_ comp lic ated _ than_ this_ ._

so I've been going to Fukushima every year since the accident, and I measure independently and with other scientists, on land, in the river -- and this time we wanted to take the kids.
so_ I_ '_ ve_ been_ going_ to_ F u k us hi ma _ every_ year_ si nce _ the_ ac ci den t_ , \ 3 2 ;_ and_ I_ meas ure_ inde pe nd ent ly_ and_ with_ other_ scientist s_ , \ 3 2 ;_ on_ lan d_ , \ 3 2 ;_ in_ the_ ri ver _ \ 3 2 ; - - \ 3 2 ;_ and_ this_ time_ we_ want ed_ to_ take_ the_ kids_ ._

so of course we didn't take the kids, the parents wouldn't allow that to happen.
so_ of_ cour se_ we_ di d n_ '_ t_ take_ the_ kids_ , \ 3 2 ;_ the_ parents_ wo ul d n_ '_ t_ allow _ that_ to_ happen _ ._

but every night we would report to "Mission Control" -- different masks they're wearing.
but_ every_ night_ we_ would_ rep ort _ to_ \ 3 2 ; "_ M is sion _ C ont ro l_ " \ 3 2 ; - - \ 3 2 ;_ different_ mas ks _ they_ '_ re_ we ar ing_ ._

it could look like they didn't take the work seriously, but they really did because they're going to have to live with radioactivity their whole life.
it_ could_ look_ like_ they_ di d n_ '_ t_ take_ the_ work_ ser io us ly_ , \ 3 2 ;_ but_ they_ really_ did_ because_ they_ '_ re_ going_ to_ have_ to_ live_ with_ radio act ivi ty_ their_ who le_ life_ ._

and so what we did with them is that we'd discuss the data we collected that day, and talk about where we should be going next -- strategy, itinerary, etc...
and_ so_ what_ we_ did_ with_ them_ is_ that_ we_ '_ d_ dis cus s_ the_ da ta _ we_ colle cte d_ that_ day _ , \ 3 2 ;_ and_ talk_ about_ where_ we_ should_ be_ going_ next_ \ 3 2 ; - - \ 3 2 ;_ stra te g y_ , \ 3 2 ;_ iti ner ar y_ , \ 3 2 ;_ et c_ ... _

and to do this, we built a very rough topographical map of the region around the nuclear power plant.
and_ to_ do_ this_ , \ 3 2 ;_ we_ built _ a_ very_ ro ugh _ to po gra phi cal _ ma p_ of_ the_ re gi on_ around_ the_ nu clear _ power_ plan t_ ._

and so we built the elevation map, we sprinkled pigments to represent real-time data for radioactivity, and we sprayed water to simulate the rainfall.
and_ so_ we_ built _ the_ el ev ation_ ma p_ , \ 3 2 ;_ we_ sp ri nk led _ pi g ment s_ to_ repr es ent_ real _ - _ time_ da ta _ for_ radio act ivi ty_ , \ 3 2 ;_ and_ we_ sp ra ye d_ water _ to_ si mul ate_ the_ rai n fall _ ._

and with this we could see that the radioactive dust was washing from the top of the mountain into the river system, and leaking into the ocean.
and_ with_ this_ we_ could_ see_ that_ the_ radio act ive_ du st_ was_ wa shi ng_ from_ the_ to p_ of_ the_ mo un tain_ into_ the_ ri ver _ system _ , \ 3 2 ;_ and_ lea king_ into_ the_ ocean _ ._

so it was a rough estimate.
so_ it_ was_ a_ ro ugh _ esti mat e_ ._

but with this in mind, we organized this expedition, which was the closest civilians have been to the nuclear power plant.
but_ with_ this_ in_ min d_ , \ 3 2 ;_ we_ organi ze d_ this_ expe di tion_ , \ 3 2 ;_ which_ was_ the_ close st_ ci vi li an s_ have_ been_ to_ the_ nu clear _ power_ plan t_ ._

we are sailing 1.5 kilometers away from the nuclear power plant, and with the help of the local fisherman, we are collecting sediment from the seabed with a custom sediment sampler we've invented and built.
we_ are_ sa ili ng_ 1_ ._ 5_ ki lo met ers_ away_ from_ the_ nu clear _ power_ plan t_ , \ 3 2 ;_ and_ with_ the_ help_ of_ the_ loca l_ fi she r man _ , \ 3 2 ;_ we_ are_ colle cti ng_ sed ime nt_ from_ the_ sea be d_ with_ a_ cus to m_ sed ime nt_ sa mp ler _ we_ '_ ve_ invent ed_ and_ built _ ._

we pack the sediment into small bags, we then dispatch them to hundreds of small bags that we send to different universities, and we produce the map of the seabed radioactivity, especially in estuaries where the fish will reproduce, and I will hope that we will have improved the safety of the local fishermen and of your favorite sushi.
we_ pa ck_ the_ sed ime nt_ into_ small_ ba g s_ , \ 3 2 ;_ we_ then_ dis pat ch_ them_ to_ hu nd re ds_ of_ small_ ba g s_ that_ we_ se nd_ to_ different_ uni vers iti es_ , \ 3 2 ;_ and_ we_ produce _ the_ ma p_ of_ the_ sea be d_ radio act ivi ty_ , \ 3 2 ;_ es pe ci ally_ in_ est ua ri es_ where_ the_ fi sh_ will_ repr od uc e_ , \ 3 2 ;_ and_ I_ will_ hope _ that_ we_ will_ have_ imp ro ved_ the_ sa fe ty_ of_ the_ loca l_ fi she r men _ and_ of_ your_ fa vo rit e_ su shi _ ._

you can see a progression here -- we've gone from a local problem to a remote problem to a global problem.
you_ can_ see_ a_ pro gre ssi on_ here_ \ 3 2 ; - - \ 3 2 ;_ we_ '_ ve_ go ne_ from_ a_ loca l_ problem _ to_ a_ re mot e_ problem _ to_ a_ gl ob al_ problem _ ._

and it's been super exciting to work at these different scales, with also very simple, open-source technologies.
and_ it_ '_ s_ been_ su per _ ex ci ting_ to_ work_ at_ these_ different_ scale s_ , \ 3 2 ;_ with_ also_ very_ simpl e_ , \ 3 2 ;_ ope n_ - _ so ur ce_ tec hn ologi es_ ._

but at the same time, it's been increasingly frustrating because we have only started to measure the damage that we have done.
but_ at_ the_ same_ time_ , \ 3 2 ;_ it_ '_ s_ been_ incre as ing ly_ fr ust rat ing_ because_ we_ have_ only_ started_ to_ meas ure_ the_ da mag e_ that_ we_ have_ do ne_ ._

we haven't even started to try to solve the problems.
we_ ha ve n_ '_ t_ even_ started_ to_ try_ to_ sol ve_ the_ problem s_ ._

and so I wonder if we should just take a leap and try to invent better ways to do all these things.
and_ so_ I_ wo nd er_ if_ we_ should_ just_ take_ a_ lea p_ and_ try_ to_ invent _ better_ way s_ to_ do_ all_ these_ things_ ._

and so the classroom started to feel a little bit small, so we found an industrial site in Hong Kong, and we turned it into the largest mega-space focused on social and environmental impact.
and_ so_ the_ cla ss ro om _ started_ to_ feel_ a_ little_ bit_ small_ , \ 3 2 ;_ so_ we_ found_ an_ ind ust ri al_ site _ in_ Ho ng_ K ong _ , \ 3 2 ;_ and_ we_ turned_ it_ into_ the_ large st_ me ga _ - _ spa ce_ fo cus ed_ on_ social_ and_ environment al_ imp act _ ._

it's in central Hong Kong, and it's a place we can work with wood, metal, chemistry, a bit of biology, a bit of optics, basically you can build pretty much everything there.

and its a place where adults and kids can play together.

it's a place where kids' dreams can come true, with the help of adults, and where adults can be kids again.

so plastic, oil and radioactivity are horrible, horrible legacies, but the very worst legacy that we can leave our children is lies.
so_ plastic _ , \ 3 2 ;_ oi l_ and_ radio act ivi ty_ are_ ho rr ible_ , \ 3 2 ;_ ho rr ible_ le ga ci es_ , \ 3 2 ;_ but_ the_ very_ wor st_ le ga cy _ that_ we_ can_ lea ve_ our_ children_ is_ lie s_ ._

we can no longer afford to shield the kids from the ugly truth because we need their imagination to invent the solutions.
we_ can_ no_ long er_ aff or d_ to_ shi el d_ the_ kids_ from_ the_ u gl y_ tru th_ because_ we_ need_ their_ imagin ation_ to_ invent _ the_ sol uti ons _ ._

so we started designing different environments, different scaffolds, and we discovered that the shape, the composition, the structure of the cocoon, was directly informed by the environment.

silkworms are often boiled to death inside their cocoons, their silk unraveled and used in the textile industry.

we then created holes, or apertures, that would lock in the rays of light and heat, distributing those silkworms on the structure.

this continued after high school, and at a certain point, I began to notice this pattern in myself where I would become interested in an area and I would dive in, become all-consumed, and I'd get to be pretty good at whatever it was, and then I would hit this point where I'd start to get bored.

in the year 1901, a woman called Auguste was taken to a medical asylum in Frankfurt.

her doctor was called Alois.

if Auguste had instead been alive today, we could offer her no more help than Alois was able to 114 years ago.

Alzheimer's now affects 40 million people worldwide.

already in the United States alone, Alzheimer's care costs 200 billion dollars every year.

one out of every five Medicare dollars get spent on Alzheimer's.

it is today the most expensive disease, and costs are projected to increase fivefold by 2050, as the baby boomer generation ages.

we understand less about the science of Alzheimer's than other diseases because we've invested less time and money into researching it.
we_ understand_ less _ about_ the_ sc ien ce_ of_ Al z he ime r_ '_ s_ than_ other_ disease s_ because_ we_ '_ ve_ inv est ed_ less _ time_ and_ mon ey _ into_ research ing_ it_ ._

the US government spends 10 times more every year on cancer research than on Alzheimer's despite the fact that Alzheimer's costs us more and causes a similar number of deaths each year as cancer.

the lack of resources stems from a more fundamental cause: a lack of awareness.
the_ la ck_ of_ res ou rc es_ ste ms_ from_ a_ more_ fu nd ame nt al_ cause _ : \ 3 2 ;_ a_ la ck_ of_ aw are nes s_ ._

because here's what few people know but everyone should: Alzheimer's is a disease, and we can cure it.

for most of the past 114 years, everyone, including scientists, mistakenly confused Alzheimer's with aging.

we thought that becoming senile was a normal and inevitable part of getting old.
we_ thought_ that_ bec om ing_ se ni le_ was_ a_ nor ma l_ and_ ine vi table _ part_ of_ get ting_ old _ ._

but we only have to look at a picture of a healthy aged brain compared to the brain of an Alzheimer's patient to see the real physical damage caused by this disease.

as well as triggering severe loss of memory and mental abilities, the damage to the brain caused by Alzheimer's significantly reduces life expectancy and is always fatal.

for almost a century, we didn't know much about these.

today we know they're made from protein molecules.
today_ we_ know_ they_ '_ re_ made_ from_ prot ei n_ mo lec ul es_ ._

you can imagine a protein molecule as a piece of paper that normally folds into an elaborate piece of origami.
you_ can_ imagin e_ a_ prot ei n_ mo lec ul e_ as_ a_ piece _ of_ paper _ that_ nor ma ll y_ fol ds_ into_ an_ el ab orat e_ piece _ of_ ori ga mi _ ._

there are spots on the paper that are sticky.
there_ are_ spo ts_ on_ the_ paper _ that_ are_ stic k y_ ._

and when it folds correctly, these sticky bits end up on the inside.
and_ when_ it_ fol ds_ cor rect ly_ , \ 3 2 ;_ these_ stic k y_ bit s_ end _ up_ on_ the_ inside_ ._

but sometimes things go wrong, and some sticky bits are on the outside.
but_ somet imes_ things_ go_ wrong_ , \ 3 2 ;_ and_ some_ stic k y_ bit s_ are_ on_ the_ out side _ ._

this causes the protein molecules to stick to each other, forming clumps that eventually become large plaques and tangles.

these worms, on the other hand, have protein molecules sticking together inside them -- like humans with Alzheimer's.

this is just an initial positive result, but research like this shows us that Alzheimer's is a disease that we can understand and we can cure.

"to Fall in Love With Anyone, Do This."
"_ to_ F all_ in_ Lo ve_ W ith _ A n yon e_ , \ 3 2 ;_ D o_ Th is_ ."_

and the article is about a psychological study designed to create romantic love in the laboratory, and my own experience trying the study myself one night last summer.
and_ the_ article _ is_ about_ a_ psych ologi cal _ study_ designe d_ to_ create_ romantic_ love_ in_ the_ lab orat ory _ , \ 3 2 ;_ and_ my_ own_ experience _ try ing_ the_ study_ myself_ one_ night_ last_ su mm er_ ._

so the procedure is fairly simple: two strangers take turns asking each other 36 increasingly personal questions and then they stare into each other's eyes without speaking for four minutes.
so_ the_ pro ce du re_ is_ fai r ly_ simpl e_ : \ 3 2 ;_ two_ stra nge rs_ take_ tur ns_ ask ing_ each_ other_ 36_ incre as ing ly_ person al_ questions_ and_ then_ they_ star e_ into_ each_ other_ '_ s_ ey es_ without_ spe ak ing_ for_ four_ min ut es_ ._

so here are a couple of sample questions.
so_ here_ are_ a_ cou ple _ of_ sa mp le_ questions_ ._

number 12: if you could wake up tomorrow having gained any one quality or ability, what would it be?
number_ 1 2_ : \ 3 2 ;_ if_ you_ could_ wa ke_ up_ to mor ro w_ havi ng_ ga ine d_ any_ one_ q ual ity_ or_ abilit y_ , \ 3 2 ;_ what_ would_ it_ be_ ?_

number 28: when did you last cry in front of another person?
number_ 2 8_ : \ 3 2 ;_ when_ did_ you_ last_ cr y_ in_ front_ of_ another_ person _ ?_

by yourself?
by_ you rsel f_ ?_

as you can see, they really do get more personal as they go along.
as_ you_ can_ see_ , \ 3 2 ;_ they_ really_ do_ get_ more_ person al_ as_ they_ go_ alon g_ ._

number 30, I really like this one: tell your partner what you like about them; be very honest this time, saying things you might not say to someone you just met.
number_ 30 _ , \ 3 2 ;_ I_ really_ like_ this_ one_ : \ 3 2 ;_ tell_ your_ part ner _ what_ you_ like_ about_ them_ ; \ 3 2 ;_ be_ very_ ho nes t_ this_ time_ , \ 3 2 ;_ say ing_ things_ you_ might_ not_ say_ to_ someone_ you_ just_ met _ ._

so when I first came across this study a few years earlier, one detail really stuck out to me, and that was the rumor that two of the participants had gotten married six months later, and they'd invited the entire lab to the ceremony.
so_ when_ I_ first_ came_ across_ this_ study_ a_ few_ years_ ear lie r_ , \ 3 2 ;_ one_ de tai l_ really_ stu ck_ out_ to_ me_ , \ 3 2 ;_ and_ that_ was_ the_ ru mor _ that_ two_ of_ the_ part ici pa nt s_ had_ go tte n_ ma rr ie d_ si x _ mon ths _ late r_ , \ 3 2 ;_ and_ they_ '_ d_ inv ite d_ the_ entire _ lab _ to_ the_ cer em on y_ ._

so I was of course very skeptical about this process of just manufacturing romantic love, but of course I was intrigued.
so_ I_ was_ of_ cour se_ very_ s ke pt ical_ about_ this_ process _ of_ just_ man u fact uri ng_ romantic_ love_ , \ 3 2 ;_ but_ of_ cour se_ I_ was_ int rig ue d_ ._

and when I got the chance to try this study myself, with someone I knew but not particularly well, I wasn't expecting to fall in love.
and_ when_ I_ got_ the_ chan ce_ to_ try_ this_ study_ myself_ , \ 3 2 ;_ with_ someone_ I_ k new_ but_ not_ particular ly_ well _ , \ 3 2 ;_ I_ wa s n_ '_ t_ expe cti ng_ to_ fall _ in_ love_ ._

but then we did, and -- And I thought it made a good story, so I sent it to the Modern Love column a few months later.
but_ then_ we_ did_ , \ 3 2 ;_ and_ \ 3 2 ; - - \ 3 2 ;_ A nd_ I_ thought_ it_ made_ a_ good_ story_ , \ 3 2 ;_ so_ I_ se nt_ it_ to_ the_ M od er n_ Lo ve_ col um n_ a_ few_ mon ths _ late r_ ._

now, this was published in January, and now it is August, so I'm guessing that some of you are probably wondering, are we still together?
now_ , \ 3 2 ;_ this_ was_ publish ed_ in_ J an ua ry_ , \ 3 2 ;_ and_ now_ it_ is_ August _ , \ 3 2 ;_ so_ I_ '_ m_ gu ess ing_ that_ some_ of_ you_ are_ pro bab ly_ wo nd ering _ , \ 3 2 ;_ are_ we_ still_ together_ ?_

and the reason I think you might be wondering this is because I have been asked this question again and again and again for the past seven months.
and_ the_ reason _ I_ think_ you_ might_ be_ wo nd ering _ this_ is_ because_ I_ have_ been_ asked_ this_ question_ again _ and_ again _ and_ again _ for_ the_ past_ se ve n_ mon ths _ ._

and this question is really what I want to talk about today.
and_ this_ question_ is_ really_ what_ I_ want_ to_ talk_ about_ today_ ._

but let's come back to it.
but_ let _ '_ s_ come_ back_ to_ it_ ._

so the week before the article came out, I was very nervous.
so_ the_ we e k_ before_ the_ article _ came_ out_ , \ 3 2 ;_ I_ was_ very_ ner vo us_ ._

I had been working on a book about love stories for the past few years, so I had gotten used to writing about my own experiences with romantic love on my blog.
I_ had_ been_ work ing_ on_ a_ bo o k_ about_ love_ stor ies_ for_ the_ past_ few_ years_ , \ 3 2 ;_ so_ I_ had_ go tte n_ used_ to_ w rit ing_ about_ my_ own_ experience s_ with_ romantic_ love_ on_ my_ blo g_ ._

but a blog post might get a couple hundred views at the most, and those were usually just my Facebook friends, and I figured my article in the New York Times would probably get a few thousand views.
but_ a_ blo g_ pos t_ might_ get_ a_ cou ple _ hu nd red_ views _ at_ the_ most_ , \ 3 2 ;_ and_ those_ were_ us ually_ just_ my_ F ac e bo o k_ friend s_ , \ 3 2 ;_ and_ I_ figure d_ my_ article _ in_ the_ N ew _ Y or k_ T imes_ would_ pro bab ly_ get_ a_ few_ thou san d_ views _ ._

and that felt like a lot of attention on a relatively new relationship.
and_ that_ fe lt _ like_ a_ lot_ of_ att enti on_ on_ a_ rel ati vel y_ new_ relationship _ ._

but as it turned out, I had no idea.
but_ as_ it_ turned_ out_ , \ 3 2 ;_ I_ had_ no_ idea_ ._

so the article was published online on a Friday evening, and by Saturday, this had happened to the traffic on my blog.
so_ the_ article _ was_ publish ed_ on line _ on_ a_ F ri day _ ev en ing_ , \ 3 2 ;_ and_ by_ S at ur day _ , \ 3 2 ;_ this_ had_ happen ed_ to_ the_ tra ff ic_ on_ my_ blo g_ ._

and by Sunday, both the Today Show and Good Morning America had called.
and_ by_ S und a y_ , \ 3 2 ;_ bot h_ the_ T od a y_ S how_ and_ G o od_ M or ning _ A mer ica _ had_ called_ ._

within a month, the article would receive over 8 million views, and I was, to say the least, underprepared for this sort of attention.
wi thin _ a_ mon th_ , \ 3 2 ;_ the_ article _ would_ rec ei ve_ over_ 8_ mil lion_ views _ , \ 3 2 ;_ and_ I_ was_ , \ 3 2 ;_ to_ say_ the_ lea st_ , \ 3 2 ;_ under pre pare d_ for_ this_ sor t_ of_ att enti on_ ._

it's one thing to work up the confidence to write honestly about your experiences with love, but it is another thing to discover that your love life has made international news -- and to realize that people across the world are genuinely invested in the status of your new relationship.
it_ '_ s_ one_ thing_ to_ work_ up_ the_ conf ide nce _ to_ write _ ho nes tl y_ about_ your_ experience s_ with_ love_ , \ 3 2 ;_ but_ it_ is_ another_ thing_ to_ discover _ that_ your_ love_ life_ has_ made_ inter na tion al_ ne w s_ \ 3 2 ; - - \ 3 2 ;_ and_ to_ real ize _ that_ people_ across_ the_ world_ are_ gen u ine ly_ inv est ed_ in_ the_ sta tu s_ of_ your_ new_ relationship _ ._

and when people called or emailed, which they did every day for weeks, they always asked the same question first: are you guys still together?
and_ when_ people_ called_ or_ em a il ed_ , \ 3 2 ;_ which_ they_ did_ every_ day _ for_ we e ks _ , \ 3 2 ;_ they_ always_ asked_ the_ same_ question_ first_ : \ 3 2 ;_ are_ you_ gu ys_ still_ together_ ?_

in fact, as I was preparing this talk, I did a quick search of my email inbox for the phrase "Are you still together?"
in_ fact _ , \ 3 2 ;_ as_ I_ was_ pre pa ring_ this_ talk_ , \ 3 2 ;_ I_ did_ a_ qui ck_ sea rc h_ of_ my_ em a il _ in box_ for_ the_ ph ra se_ \ 3 2 ; "_ A re_ you_ still_ together_ ?"_

and several messages popped up immediately.
and_ se ver al_ mes sa ge s_ po pp ed_ up_ im medi ate ly_ ._

they were from students and journalists and friendly strangers like this one.
they_ were_ from_ students _ and_ j ou rna li sts _ and_ friend ly_ stra nge rs_ like_ this_ one_ ._

I did radio interviews and they asked.
I_ did_ radio _ inter views _ and_ they_ asked_ ._

I even gave a talk, and one woman shouted up to the stage, "Hey Mandy, where's your boyfriend?"
I_ even_ ga ve_ a_ talk_ , \ 3 2 ;_ and_ one_ woman _ sho ut ed_ up_ to_ the_ sta ge_ , \ 3 2 ; "_ He y_ Ma nd y_ , \ 3 2 ;_ where_ '_ s_ your_ bo y friend _ ?"_

and I promptly turned bright red.
and_ I_ pro mp tl y_ turned_ bri ght _ red_ ._

I understand that this is part of the deal.
I_ understand_ that_ this_ is_ part_ of_ the_ dea l_ ._

if you write about your relationship in an international newspaper, you should expect people to feel comfortable asking about it.
if_ you_ write _ about_ your_ relationship _ in_ an_ inter na tion al_ ne w spa per _ , \ 3 2 ;_ you_ should_ expe ct_ people_ to_ feel_ com for table _ ask ing_ about_ it_ ._

but I just wasn't prepared for the scope of the response.
but_ I_ just_ wa s n_ '_ t_ pre pare d_ for_ the_ sc ope _ of_ the_ res po ns e_ ._

the 36 questions seem to have taken on a life of their own.
the_ 36_ questions_ see m_ to_ have_ tak en_ on_ a_ life_ of_ their_ own_ ._

in fact, the New York Times published a follow-up article for Valentine's Day, which featured readers' experiences of trying the study themselves, with varying degrees of success.
in_ fact _ , \ 3 2 ;_ the_ N ew _ Y or k_ T imes_ publish ed_ a_ fol low _ - _ up_ article _ for_ V al enti ne_ '_ s_ D a y_ , \ 3 2 ;_ which_ fe ature d_ read ers_ ' \ 3 2 ;_ experience s_ of_ try ing_ the_ study_ the ms el ves_ , \ 3 2 ;_ with_ var ying_ de gre es_ of_ su c ces s_ ._

so my first impulse in the face of all of this attention was to become very protective of my own relationship.
so_ my_ first_ imp ul se_ in_ the_ face _ of_ all_ of_ this_ att enti on_ was_ to_ become_ very_ prot ecti ve_ of_ my_ own_ relationship _ ._

I said no to every request for the two of us to do a media appearance together.
I_ said _ no_ to_ every_ re que st_ for_ the_ two_ of_ us_ to_ do_ a_ medi a_ app ear ance_ together_ ._

I turned down TV interviews, and I said no to every request for photos of the two us.
I_ turned_ down _ T V _ inter views _ , \ 3 2 ;_ and_ I_ said _ no_ to_ every_ re que st_ for_ ph ot os _ of_ the_ two_ us_ ._

I think I was afraid that we would become inadvertent icons for the process of falling in love, a position I did not at all feel qualified for.
I_ think_ I_ was_ af rai d_ that_ we_ would_ become_ in ad ver tent _ ic ons _ for_ the_ process _ of_ fall ing_ in_ love_ , \ 3 2 ;_ a_ pos ition _ I_ did_ not_ at_ all_ feel_ q ual i fi ed_ for_ ._

and I get it: people didn't just want to know if the study worked, they wanted to know if it really worked: that is, if it was capable of producing love that would last, not just a fling, but real love, sustainable love.
and_ I_ get_ it_ : \ 3 2 ;_ people_ di d n_ '_ t_ just_ want_ to_ know_ if_ the_ study_ work ed_ , \ 3 2 ;_ they_ want ed_ to_ know_ if_ it_ really_ work ed_ : \ 3 2 ;_ that_ is_ , \ 3 2 ;_ if_ it_ was_ ca pa ble_ of_ pro duc ing_ love_ that_ would_ last_ , \ 3 2 ;_ not_ just_ a_ fl ing_ , \ 3 2 ;_ but_ real _ love_ , \ 3 2 ;_ su sta in able_ love_ ._

but this was a question I didn't feel capable of answering.
but_ this_ was_ a_ question_ I_ di d n_ '_ t_ feel_ ca pa ble_ of_ answer ing_ ._

my own relationship was only a few months old, and I felt like people were asking the wrong question in the first place.
my_ own_ relationship _ was_ only_ a_ few_ mon ths _ old _ , \ 3 2 ;_ and_ I_ fe lt _ like_ people_ were_ ask ing_ the_ wrong_ question_ in_ the_ first_ place_ ._

what would knowing whether or not we were still together really tell them?
what_ would_ know ing_ whe ther_ or_ not_ we_ were_ still_ together_ really_ tell_ them_ ?_

if the answer was no, would it make the experience of doing these 36 questions any less worthwhile?
if_ the_ answer _ was_ no_ , \ 3 2 ;_ would_ it_ make_ the_ experience _ of_ do ing_ these_ 36_ questions_ any_ less _ wor th while_ ?_

Dr. Arthur Aron first wrote about these questions in this study here in 1997, and here, the researcher's goal was not to produce romantic love.
D r_ . \ 3 2 ;_ A rt hu r_ A ron _ first_ wro te_ about_ these_ questions_ in_ this_ study_ here_ in_ 19 9 7 _ , \ 3 2 ;_ and_ here_ , \ 3 2 ;_ the_ research er_ '_ s_ go al_ was_ not_ to_ produce _ romantic_ love_ ._

instead, they wanted to foster interpersonal closeness among college students, by using what Aron called "sustained, escalating, reciprocal, personalistic self-disclosure."
instead _ , \ 3 2 ;_ they_ want ed_ to_ fo ste r_ inter person al_ close nes s_ am ong _ colle ge_ students _ , \ 3 2 ;_ by_ using_ what_ A ron _ called_ \ 3 2 ; "_ su sta ine d_ , \ 3 2 ;_ es cal ati ng_ , \ 3 2 ;_ rec i pro cal _ , \ 3 2 ;_ person ali stic _ self _ - _ dis cl os ure_ ."_

sounds romantic, doesn't it?
sound s_ romantic_ , \ 3 2 ;_ does n_ '_ t_ it_ ?_

but the study did work.
but_ the_ study_ did_ work_ ._

the participants did feel closer after doing it, and several subsequent studies have also used Aron's fast friends protocol as a way to quickly create trust and intimacy between strangers.
the_ part ici pa nt s_ did_ feel_ close r_ after_ do ing_ it_ , \ 3 2 ;_ and_ se ver al_ su b se que nt_ stu die s_ have_ also_ used_ A ron _ '_ s_ fas t_ friend s_ prot oc ol _ as_ a_ way_ to_ qui ckl y_ create_ tru st_ and_ int im ac y_ between_ stra nge rs_ ._

they've used it between members of the police and members of community, and they've used it between people of opposing political ideologies.
they_ '_ ve_ used_ it_ between_ me mber s_ of_ the_ po lic e_ and_ me mber s_ of_ communi ty_ , \ 3 2 ;_ and_ they_ '_ ve_ used_ it_ between_ people_ of_ op pos ing_ po lit ical_ ide ologi es_ ._

the original version of the story, the one that I tried last summer, that pairs the personal questions with four minutes of eye contact, was referenced in this article, but unfortunately it was never published.
the_ ori gi na l_ vers ion_ of_ the_ story_ , \ 3 2 ;_ the_ one_ that_ I_ tri ed_ last_ su mm er_ , \ 3 2 ;_ that_ pa ir s_ the_ person al_ questions_ with_ four_ min ut es_ of_ ey e_ conta ct_ , \ 3 2 ;_ was_ ref eren ce d_ in_ this_ article _ , \ 3 2 ;_ but_ un for tu na tel y_ it_ was_ never_ publish ed_ ._

so a few months ago, I was giving a talk at a small liberal arts college, and a student came up to me afterwards and he said, kind of shyly, "So, I tried your study, and it didn't work."
so_ a_ few_ mon ths _ ago _ , \ 3 2 ;_ I_ was_ gi vi ng_ a_ talk_ at_ a_ small_ li be ra l_ art s_ colle ge_ , \ 3 2 ;_ and_ a_ stu den t_ came_ up_ to_ me_ af ter ward s_ and_ he_ said _ , \ 3 2 ;_ kind_ of_ s hy ly_ , \ 3 2 ; "_ S o_ , \ 3 2 ;_ I_ tri ed_ your_ study_ , \ 3 2 ;_ and_ it_ di d n_ '_ t_ work_ ."_

he seemed a little mystified by this.
he_ see med_ a_ little_ my sti fi ed_ by_ this_ ._

"you mean, you didn't fall in love with the person you did it with?" I asked.
"_ you_ mean _ , \ 3 2 ;_ you_ di d n_ '_ t_ fall _ in_ love_ with_ the_ person _ you_ did_ it_ with_ ? " \ 3 2 ;_ I_ asked_ ._

"well..." He paused.
"_ well _ ... " \ 3 2 ;_ He _ pa used_ ._

"I think she just wants to be friends."
"_ I_ think_ she_ just_ want s_ to_ be_ friend s_ ."_

"but did you become better friends?" I asked.
"_ but_ did_ you_ become_ better_ friend s_ ? " \ 3 2 ;_ I_ asked_ ._

"did you feel like you got to really know each other after doing the study?"
"_ did_ you_ feel_ like_ you_ got_ to_ really_ know_ each_ other_ after_ do ing_ the_ study_ ?"_

he nodded.
he_ no dd ed_ ._

"so, then it worked," I said.
"_ so_ , \ 3 2 ;_ then_ it_ work ed_ , " \ 3 2 ;_ I_ said _ ._

I don't think this is the answer he was looking for.
I_ do n_ '_ t_ think_ this_ is_ the_ answer _ he_ was_ look ing_ for_ ._

in fact, I don't think this is the answer that any of us are looking for when it comes to love.
in_ fact _ , \ 3 2 ;_ I_ do n_ '_ t_ think_ this_ is_ the_ answer _ that_ any_ of_ us_ are_ look ing_ for_ when_ it_ com es_ to_ love_ ._

I first came across this study when I was 29 and I was going through a really difficult breakup.
I_ first_ came_ across_ this_ study_ when_ I_ was_ 2 9 _ and_ I_ was_ going_ through_ a_ really_ diff ic ult _ brea k up_ ._

I had been in the relationship since I was 20, which was basically my entire adult life, and he was my first real love, and I had no idea how or if I could make a life without him.
I_ had_ been_ in_ the_ relationship _ si nce _ I_ was_ 20 _ , \ 3 2 ;_ which_ was_ bas ically_ my_ entire _ adult _ life_ , \ 3 2 ;_ and_ he_ was_ my_ first_ real _ love_ , \ 3 2 ;_ and_ I_ had_ no_ idea_ how_ or_ if_ I_ could_ make_ a_ life_ without_ hi m_ ._

so I turned to science.
so_ I_ turned_ to_ sc ien ce_ ._

I researched everything I could find about the science of romantic love, and I think I was hoping that it might somehow inoculate me from heartache.
I_ research ed_ everything_ I_ could_ find_ about_ the_ sc ien ce_ of_ romantic_ love_ , \ 3 2 ;_ and_ I_ think_ I_ was_ ho pi ng_ that_ it_ might_ some how_ in oc ul ate_ me_ from_ hear ta che _ ._

I don't know if I realized this at the time -- I thought I was just doing research for this book I was writing -- but it seems really obvious in retrospect.
I_ do n_ '_ t_ know_ if_ I_ realized _ this_ at_ the_ time_ \ 3 2 ; - - \ 3 2 ;_ I_ thought_ I_ was_ just_ do ing_ research _ for_ this_ bo o k_ I_ was_ w rit ing_ \ 3 2 ; - - \ 3 2 ;_ but_ it_ see ms_ really_ ob vi ous_ in_ re tr os pe ct_ ._

I hoped that if I armed myself with the knowledge of romantic love, I might never have to feel as terrible and lonely as I did then.
I_ hope d_ that_ if_ I_ armed_ myself_ with_ the_ know led ge_ of_ romantic_ love_ , \ 3 2 ;_ I_ might_ never_ have_ to_ feel_ as_ terr ible_ and_ lo ne ly_ as_ I_ did_ then_ ._

and all this knowledge has been useful in some ways.
and_ all_ this_ know led ge_ has_ been_ use ful_ in_ some_ way s_ ._

I am more patient with love. I am more relaxed.
I_ am_ more_ pat ien t_ with_ love_ . \ 3 2 ;_ I_ am_ more_ rel a x ed_ ._

I am more confident about asking for what I want.
I_ am_ more_ conf ident _ about_ ask ing_ for_ what_ I_ want_ ._

but I can also see myself more clearly, and I can see that what I want is sometimes more than can reasonably be asked for.
but_ I_ can_ also_ see_ myself_ more_ clear ly_ , \ 3 2 ;_ and_ I_ can_ see_ that_ what_ I_ want_ is_ somet imes_ more_ than_ can_ reason abl y_ be_ asked_ for_ ._

what I want from love is a guarantee, not just that I am loved today and that I will be loved tomorrow, but that I will continue to be loved by the person I love indefinitely.
what_ I_ want_ from_ love_ is_ a_ gu ar ant ee _ , \ 3 2 ;_ not_ just_ that_ I_ am_ love d_ today_ and_ that_ I_ will_ be_ love d_ to mor ro w_ , \ 3 2 ;_ but_ that_ I_ will_ continu e_ to_ be_ love d_ by_ the_ person _ I_ love_ inde fin ite ly_ ._

maybe it's this possibility of a guarantee that people were really asking about when they wanted to know if we were still together.
maybe_ it_ '_ s_ this_ possib ili ty_ of_ a_ gu ar ant ee _ that_ people_ were_ really_ ask ing_ about_ when_ they_ want ed_ to_ know_ if_ we_ were_ still_ together_ ._

so the story that the media told about the 36 questions was that there might be a shortcut to falling in love.
so_ the_ story_ that_ the_ medi a_ to ld _ about_ the_ 36_ questions_ was_ that_ there_ might_ be_ a_ sho rt cut _ to_ fall ing_ in_ love_ ._

there might be a way to somehow mitigate some of the risk involved, and this is a very appealing story, because falling in love feels amazing, but it's also terrifying.
there_ might_ be_ a_ way_ to_ some how_ mi ti ga te_ some_ of_ the_ ris k_ inv ol ved_ , \ 3 2 ;_ and_ this_ is_ a_ very_ app ea lin g_ story_ , \ 3 2 ;_ because_ fall ing_ in_ love_ fe els _ am azin g_ , \ 3 2 ;_ but_ it_ '_ s_ also_ terr ify ing_ ._

the moment you admit to loving someone, you admit to having a lot to lose, and it's true that these questions do provide a mechanism for getting to know someone quickly, which is also a mechanism for being known, and I think this is the thing that most of us really want from love: to be known, to be seen, to be understood.
the_ mo ment_ you_ ad mi t_ to_ lo vi ng_ someone_ , \ 3 2 ;_ you_ ad mi t_ to_ havi ng_ a_ lot_ to_ los e_ , \ 3 2 ;_ and_ it_ '_ s_ true _ that_ these_ questions_ do_ provi de_ a_ me chan ism _ for_ get ting_ to_ know_ someone_ qui ckl y_ , \ 3 2 ;_ which_ is_ also_ a_ me chan ism _ for_ being_ know n_ , \ 3 2 ;_ and_ I_ think_ this_ is_ the_ thing_ that_ most_ of_ us_ really_ want_ from_ love_ : \ 3 2 ;_ to_ be_ know n_ , \ 3 2 ;_ to_ be_ see n_ , \ 3 2 ;_ to_ be_ under sto od_ ._

but I think when it comes to love, we are too willing to accept the short version of the story.
but_ I_ think_ when_ it_ com es_ to_ love_ , \ 3 2 ;_ we_ are_ too_ wi ll ing_ to_ acce pt _ the_ sho rt_ vers ion_ of_ the_ story_ ._

the version of the story that asks, "Are you still together?"
the_ vers ion_ of_ the_ story_ that_ ask s_ , \ 3 2 ; "_ A re_ you_ still_ together_ ?"_

and is content with a yes or no answer.
and_ is_ con tent _ with_ a_ ye s_ or_ no_ answer _ ._

so rather than that question, I would propose we ask some more difficult questions, questions like: how do you decide who deserves your love and who does not?
so_ rat her_ than_ that_ question_ , \ 3 2 ;_ I_ would_ pro pos e_ we_ ask_ some_ more_ diff ic ult _ questions_ , \ 3 2 ;_ questions_ like_ : \ 3 2 ;_ how_ do_ you_ deci de_ who_ des erv es_ your_ love_ and_ who_ does _ not_ ?_

how do you stay in love when things get difficult, and how do you know when to just cut and run?
how_ do_ you_ sta y_ in_ love_ when_ things_ get_ diff ic ult _ , \ 3 2 ;_ and_ how_ do_ you_ know_ when_ to_ just_ cut _ and_ ru n_ ?_

how do you live with the doubt that inevitably creeps into every relationship, or even harder, how do you live with your partner's doubt?
how_ do_ you_ live_ with_ the_ do u b t_ that_ ine vi ta bl y_ cre ep s_ into_ every_ relationship _ , \ 3 2 ;_ or_ even_ hard er_ , \ 3 2 ;_ how_ do_ you_ live_ with_ your_ part ner _ '_ s_ do u b t_ ?_

I don't necessarily know the answers to these questions, but I think they're an important start at having a more thoughtful conversation about what it means to love someone.
I_ do n_ '_ t_ ne ces sa ri ly_ know_ the_ answer s_ to_ these_ questions_ , \ 3 2 ;_ but_ I_ think_ they_ '_ re_ an_ impo rt ant _ start _ at_ havi ng_ a_ more_ thou ght ful_ con vers ation_ about_ what_ it_ mean s_ to_ love_ someone_ ._

so, if you want it, the short version of the story of my relationship is this: a year ago, an acquaintance and I did a study designed to create romantic love, and we fell in love, and we are still together, and I am so glad.
so_ , \ 3 2 ;_ if_ you_ want_ it_ , \ 3 2 ;_ the_ sho rt_ vers ion_ of_ the_ story_ of_ my_ relationship _ is_ this_ : \ 3 2 ;_ a_ year_ ago _ , \ 3 2 ;_ an_ ac q ua int ance_ and_ I_ did_ a_ study_ designe d_ to_ create_ romantic_ love_ , \ 3 2 ;_ and_ we_ fe ll_ in_ love_ , \ 3 2 ;_ and_ we_ are_ still_ together_ , \ 3 2 ;_ and_ I_ am_ so_ gla d_ ._

but falling in love is not the same thing as staying in love.
but_ fall ing_ in_ love_ is_ not_ the_ same_ thing_ as_ sta ying_ in_ love_ ._

falling in love is the easy part.
fall ing_ in_ love_ is_ the_ eas y_ part_ ._

so at the end of my article, I wrote, "Love didn't happen to us.
so_ at_ the_ end _ of_ my_ article _ , \ 3 2 ;_ I_ wro te_ , \ 3 2 ; "_ Lo ve_ di d n_ '_ t_ happen _ to_ us_ ._

we're in love because we each made the choice to be. "
we_ '_ re_ in_ love_ because_ we_ each_ made_ the_ choice _ to_ be_ . \ 3 2 ; "_

and I cringe a little when I read that now, not because it isn't true, but because at the time, I really hadn't considered everything that was contained in that choice.
and_ I_ cr ing e_ a_ little_ when_ I_ read _ that_ now_ , \ 3 2 ;_ not_ because_ it_ isn _ '_ t_ true _ , \ 3 2 ;_ but_ because_ at_ the_ time_ , \ 3 2 ;_ I_ really_ ha d n_ '_ t_ consider ed_ everything_ that_ was_ conta ine d_ in_ that_ choice _ ._

I didn't consider how many times we would each have to make that choice, and how many times I will continue to have to make that choice without knowing whether or not he will always choose me.
I_ di d n_ '_ t_ consider _ how_ many_ time s_ we_ would_ each_ have_ to_ make_ that_ choice _ , \ 3 2 ;_ and_ how_ many_ time s_ I_ will_ continu e_ to_ have_ to_ make_ that_ choice _ without_ know ing_ whe ther_ or_ not_ he_ will_ always_ cho ose _ me_ ._

I want it to be enough to have asked and answered 36 questions, and to have chosen to love someone so generous and kind and fun and to have broadcast that choice in the biggest newspaper in America.
I_ want_ it_ to_ be_ en ou gh _ to_ have_ asked_ and_ answer ed_ 36_ questions_ , \ 3 2 ;_ and_ to_ have_ cho se n_ to_ love_ someone_ so_ gener ous_ and_ kind_ and_ fu n_ and_ to_ have_ bro ad ca st_ that_ choice _ in_ the_ bi gg est_ ne w spa per _ in_ A mer ica _ ._

but what I have done instead is turn my relationship into the kind of myth I don't quite believe in.
but_ what_ I_ have_ do ne_ instead _ is_ tur n_ my_ relationship _ into_ the_ kind_ of_ my th_ I_ do n_ '_ t_ qui te_ believe_ in_ ._

and what I want, what perhaps I will spend my life wanting, is for that myth to be true.
and_ what_ I_ want_ , \ 3 2 ;_ what_ per ha p s_ I_ will_ spe nd_ my_ life_ want ing_ , \ 3 2 ;_ is_ for_ that_ my th_ to_ be_ true _ ._

I want the happy ending implied by the title to my article, which is, incidentally, the only part of the article that I didn't actually write.

but what I have instead is the chance to make the choice to love someone, and the hope that he will choose to love me back, and it is terrifying, but that's the deal with love.
but_ what_ I_ have_ instead _ is_ the_ chan ce_ to_ make_ the_ choice _ to_ love_ someone_ , \ 3 2 ;_ and_ the_ hope _ that_ he_ will_ cho ose _ to_ love_ me_ back_ , \ 3 2 ;_ and_ it_ is_ terr ify ing_ , \ 3 2 ;_ but_ that_ '_ s_ the_ dea l_ with_ love_ ._

thank you.

I was raised by lesbians in the mountains, and I sort of came like a forest gnome to New York City a while back.
I_ was_ rais ed_ by_ les bi an s_ in_ the_ mo un tai ns_ , \ 3 2 ;_ and_ I_ sor t_ of_ came_ like_ a_ fore st_ gn ome _ to_ N ew _ Y or k_ C ity_ a_ while_ back_ ._

really messed with my head, but I'll get into that later.

I'll start with when I was eight years old.
I_ '_ ll_ start _ with_ when_ I_ was_ ei ght _ years_ old _ ._

I took a wood box, and I buried a dollar bill, a pen and a fork inside this box in Colorado.
I_ too k_ a_ wo od_ box_ , \ 3 2 ;_ and_ I_ bu ri ed_ a_ do lla r_ bil l_ , \ 3 2 ;_ a_ pe n_ and_ a_ for k_ inside_ this_ box_ in_ C ol or ad o_ ._

and I thought some strange humanoids or aliens in 500 years would find this box and learn about the way our species exchanged ideas, maybe how we ate our spaghetti.
and_ I_ thought_ some_ stra nge _ human oi ds_ or_ ali en s_ in_ 50 0_ years_ would_ find_ this_ box_ and_ learn _ about_ the_ way_ our_ speci es_ ex change d_ idea s_ , \ 3 2 ;_ maybe_ how_ we_ ate_ our_ spa gh et ti _ ._

I really didn't know.
I_ really_ di d n_ '_ t_ know_ ._

anyway, this is kind of funny, because here I am, 30 years later, and I'm still making boxes.
any way_ , \ 3 2 ;_ this_ is_ kind_ of_ fu n n y_ , \ 3 2 ;_ because_ here_ I_ am_ , \ 3 2 ;_ 30 _ years_ late r_ , \ 3 2 ;_ and_ I_ '_ m_ still_ ma king_ box es_ ._

now, at some point I was in Hawaii -- I like to hike and surf and do all that weird stuff, and I was making a collage for my ma.
now_ , \ 3 2 ;_ at_ some_ point _ I_ was_ in_ Ha wa i i _ \ 3 2 ; - - \ 3 2 ;_ I_ like_ to_ hi ke_ and_ sur f_ and_ do_ all_ that_ we ird_ stu ff _ , \ 3 2 ;_ and_ I_ was_ ma king_ a_ col la ge_ for_ my_ ma _ ._

and I took a dictionary and I ripped it up, and I made it into a sort of Agnes Martin grid, and I poured resin all over it and a bee got stuck.
and_ I_ too k_ a_ dic tion ar y_ and_ I_ ri pp ed_ it_ up_ , \ 3 2 ;_ and_ I_ made_ it_ into_ a_ sor t_ of_ A gn es_ Ma rt in_ gr i d_ , \ 3 2 ;_ and_ I_ po ure d_ resi n_ all_ over_ it_ and_ a_ be e_ got_ stu ck_ ._

now, she's afraid of bees and she's allergic to them, so I poured more resin on the canvas, thinking I could hide it or something.
now_ , \ 3 2 ;_ she_ '_ s_ af rai d_ of_ be es_ and_ she_ '_ s_ all er gi c_ to_ them_ , \ 3 2 ;_ so_ I_ po ure d_ more_ resi n_ on_ the_ can va s_ , \ 3 2 ;_ thinking_ I_ could_ hi de_ it_ or_ something_ ._

instead, the opposite happened: it sort of created a magnification, like a magnifying glass, on the dictionary text.
instead _ , \ 3 2 ;_ the_ op pos ite _ happen ed_ : \ 3 2 ;_ it_ sor t_ of_ create d_ a_ mag ni fi cat ion_ , \ 3 2 ;_ like_ a_ mag ni f ying_ gla ss_ , \ 3 2 ;_ on_ the_ dic tion ar y_ te xt _ ._

so what did I do? I built more boxes.
so_ what_ did_ I_ do_ ? \ 3 2 ;_ I_ built _ more_ box es_ ._

this time, I started putting electronics, frogs, strange bottles I'd find in the street -- anything I could find -- because I was always finding things my whole life, and trying to make relationships and tell stories between these objects.
this_ time_ , \ 3 2 ;_ I_ started_ pu tt ing_ el ect ron ic s_ , \ 3 2 ;_ fr og s_ , \ 3 2 ;_ stra nge _ bot tl es_ I_ '_ d_ find_ in_ the_ stre et_ \ 3 2 ; - - \ 3 2 ;_ any thing_ I_ could_ find_ \ 3 2 ; - - \ 3 2 ;_ because_ I_ was_ always_ fin ding_ things_ my_ who le_ life_ , \ 3 2 ;_ and_ try ing_ to_ make_ relationship s_ and_ tell_ stor ies_ between_ these_ object s_ ._

so I started drawing around the objects, and I realized: holy moly, I can draw in space!
so_ I_ started_ draw ing_ around_ the_ object s_ , \ 3 2 ;_ and_ I_ realized _ : \ 3 2 ;_ ho ly_ mo ly_ , \ 3 2 ;_ I_ can_ draw _ in_ spa ce_ !_

I can make free-floating lines, like the way you would draw around a dead body at a crime scene.
I_ can_ make_ free _ - _ fl o ati ng_ line s_ , \ 3 2 ;_ like_ the_ way_ you_ would_ draw _ around_ a_ dea d_ body_ at_ a_ cr ime _ sc en e_ ._

so I took the objects out, and I created my own taxonomy of invented specimens.
so_ I_ too k_ the_ object s_ out_ , \ 3 2 ;_ and_ I_ create d_ my_ own_ ta x on om y_ of_ invent ed_ speci men s_ ._

first, botanical -- which you can kind of get a sense of.
first_ , \ 3 2 ;_ bot an ical_ \ 3 2 ; - - \ 3 2 ;_ which_ you_ can_ kind_ of_ get_ a_ sens e_ of_ ._

then I made some weird insects and creatures.
then_ I_ made_ some_ we ird_ ins ect s_ and_ cre ature s_ ._

it was really fun; I was just drawing on the layers of resin.
it_ was_ really_ fu n_ ; \ 3 2 ;_ I_ was_ just_ draw ing_ on_ the_ la ye rs_ of_ resi n_ ._

and it was cool, because I was actually starting to have shows and stuff, I was making some money, I could take my girlfriend for dinner, and like, go to Sizzler.
and_ it_ was_ coo l_ , \ 3 2 ;_ because_ I_ was_ act ually_ start ing_ to_ have_ sho w s_ and_ stu ff _ , \ 3 2 ;_ I_ was_ ma king_ some_ mon ey _ , \ 3 2 ;_ I_ could_ take_ my_ gi r lf ri end _ for_ di n ner _ , \ 3 2 ;_ and_ like_ , \ 3 2 ;_ go_ to_ S i z z ler _ ._

it was some good shit, man.
it_ was_ some_ good_ shi t_ , \ 3 2 ;_ man _ ._

at some point, I got up to the human form, life-size resin sculptures with drawings of humans inside the layers.
at_ some_ point _ , \ 3 2 ;_ I_ got_ up_ to_ the_ human_ form_ , \ 3 2 ;_ life_ - _ si ze _ resi n_ sc ul pt ure s_ with_ draw ing s_ of_ human s_ inside_ the_ la ye rs_ ._

this was great, except for one thing: I was going to die.
this_ was_ gre at_ , \ 3 2 ;_ ex ce pt _ for_ one_ thing_ : \ 3 2 ;_ I_ was_ going_ to_ die _ ._

I didn't know what to do, because the resin was going to kill me.
I_ di d n_ '_ t_ know_ what_ to_ do_ , \ 3 2 ;_ because_ the_ resi n_ was_ going_ to_ ki ll_ me_ ._

and I went to bed every night thinking about it.
and_ I_ we nt_ to_ be d_ every_ night_ thinking_ about_ it_ ._

so I tried using glass.
so_ I_ tri ed_ using_ gla ss_ ._

I started drawing on the layers of glass, almost like if you drew on a window, then you put another window, and another window, and you had all these windows together that made a three-dimensional composition.
I_ started_ draw ing_ on_ the_ la ye rs_ of_ gla ss_ , \ 3 2 ;_ al most_ like_ if_ you_ dr ew _ on_ a_ window _ , \ 3 2 ;_ then_ you_ put_ another_ window _ , \ 3 2 ;_ and_ another_ window _ , \ 3 2 ;_ and_ you_ had_ all_ these_ window s_ together_ that_ made_ a_ three_ - _ di men sion al_ comp os ition _ ._

and this really worked, because I could stop using the resin.
and_ this_ really_ work ed_ , \ 3 2 ;_ because_ I_ could_ sto p_ using_ the_ resi n_ ._

so I did this for years, which culminated in a very large work, which I call "The triptych."
so_ I_ did_ this_ for_ years_ , \ 3 2 ;_ which_ cul min ated _ in_ a_ very_ large _ work_ , \ 3 2 ;_ which_ I_ call_ \ 3 2 ; "_ Th e_ tri pt y ch_ ."_

"the triptych" was largely inspired by Hieronymus Bosch's "[The] Garden of Earthly Delights," which is a painting in the [Museo del] Prado in Spain.
"_ the_ tri pt y ch_ " \ 3 2 ;_ was_ large ly_ ins pir ed_ by_ H ie ron y mus _ B os ch_ '_ s_ \ 3 2 ; " [ _ Th e_ ] \ 3 2 ;_ G ar den _ of_ Earth ly_ D el ight s_ , " \ 3 2 ;_ which_ is_ a_ pain ting_ in_ the_ \ 3 2 ; [ _ M use o_ del _ ] \ 3 2 ;_ P ra do_ in_ S pain _ ._

do you guys know this painting?
do_ you_ gu ys_ know_ this_ pain ting_ ?_

good, it's a cool painting.
good_ , \ 3 2 ;_ it_ '_ s_ a_ coo l_ pain ting_ ._

it's kind of ahead of its time, they say.
it_ '_ s_ kind_ of_ ah ea d_ of_ its_ time_ , \ 3 2 ;_ they_ say_ ._

so, "The triptych." I'll walk you through this piece.
so_ , \ 3 2 ; "_ Th e_ tri pt y ch_ . " \ 3 2 ;_ I_ '_ ll_ wal k_ you_ through_ this_ piece _ ._

it weighs 24,000 pounds.
it_ we ig h s_ 2 4_ ,_ 0 0 0_ po und s_ ._

it's 18 feet long.
it_ '_ s_ 1 8_ fe et_ long _ ._

it's double-sided, so it's 36 feet of composition.
it_ '_ s_ do u ble_ - _ side d_ , \ 3 2 ;_ so_ it_ '_ s_ 36_ fe et_ of_ comp os ition _ ._

it's kind of weird.
it_ '_ s_ kind_ of_ we ird_ ._

well, that's the blood fountain.
well _ , \ 3 2 ;_ that_ '_ s_ the_ blo od_ fo un tain_ ._

to the left, you have Jesus and the locusts.
to_ the_ le ft _ , \ 3 2 ;_ you_ have_ J es us_ and_ the_ lo cus ts_ ._

there's a cave where all these animal-headed creatures travel between two worlds.
there_ '_ s_ a_ ca ve_ where_ all_ these_ an im al_ - _ head ed_ cre ature s_ tra vel _ between_ two_ world s_ ._

they go from the representational world, to this analog-mesh underworld, where they're hiding.
they_ go_ from_ the_ repr es ent ation al_ world_ , \ 3 2 ;_ to_ this_ an al og _ - _ mes h_ under world_ , \ 3 2 ;_ where_ they_ '_ re_ hi ding_ ._

this is where the animal-headed creatures are by the lighthouse, and they're all about to commit mass suicide into the ocean.
this_ is_ where_ the_ an im al_ - _ head ed_ cre ature s_ are_ by_ the_ light ho use _ , \ 3 2 ;_ and_ they_ '_ re_ all_ about_ to_ comm it_ mas s_ su ici de_ into_ the_ ocean _ ._

the ocean is made up of thousands of elements.
the_ ocean _ is_ made_ up_ of_ thou san ds_ of_ el em ent s_ ._

this is a bird god tied up to a battleship.
this_ is_ a_ bi rd _ go d_ ti ed_ up_ to_ a_ ba tt les hi p_ ._

Billy Graham is in the ocean; the Horizon from the oil spill; Waldo; Osama Bin Laden's shelter -- there's all kinds of weird stuff that you can find if you look really hard, in the ocean.
B il ly_ G ra ha m_ is_ in_ the_ ocean _ ; \ 3 2 ;_ the_ Ho ri z on_ from_ the_ oi l_ spi ll_ ; \ 3 2 ;_ W al do_ ; \ 3 2 ;_ O sa ma _ B in_ L ade n_ '_ s_ she lt er_ \ 3 2 ; - - \ 3 2 ;_ there_ '_ s_ all_ ki nds _ of_ we ird_ stu ff _ that_ you_ can_ find_ if_ you_ look_ really_ hard _ , \ 3 2 ;_ in_ the_ ocean _ ._

anyway, this is a lady creature.
any way_ , \ 3 2 ;_ this_ is_ a_ la d y_ cre ature _ ._

she's coming out of the ocean, and she's spitting oil into one hand and she has clouds coming out of her other hand.
she_ '_ s_ com ing_ out_ of_ the_ ocean _ , \ 3 2 ;_ and_ she_ '_ s_ spi tt ing_ oi l_ into_ one_ hand _ and_ she_ has_ cloud s_ com ing_ out_ of_ her_ other_ hand _ ._

her hands are like scales, and she has the mythological reference of the Earth and cosmos in balance.
her_ hand s_ are_ like_ scale s_ , \ 3 2 ;_ and_ she_ has_ the_ my th ologi cal _ ref eren ce_ of_ the_ Earth _ and_ co sm os _ in_ ba lan ce_ ._

so that's one side of "The triptych."
so_ that_ '_ s_ one_ side _ of_ \ 3 2 ; "_ Th e_ tri pt y ch_ ."_

it's a little narrative thing.
it_ '_ s_ a_ little_ na rr ati ve_ thing_ ._

that's her hand that she's spitting into.
that_ '_ s_ her_ hand _ that_ she_ '_ s_ spi tt ing_ into_ ._

and then, when you go to the other side, she has like a trunk, like a bird's beak, and she's spitting clouds out of her trunk.
and_ then_ , \ 3 2 ;_ when_ you_ go_ to_ the_ other_ side _ , \ 3 2 ;_ she_ has_ like_ a_ tru nk _ , \ 3 2 ;_ like_ a_ bi rd _ '_ s_ bea k_ , \ 3 2 ;_ and_ she_ '_ s_ spi tt ing_ cloud s_ out_ of_ her_ tru nk _ ._

then she has an 18-foot-long serpent's tail that connects "The triptych."
then_ she_ has_ an_ 1 8_ - _ fo ot _ - _ long _ ser pe nt_ '_ s_ tai l_ that_ con ne ct s_ \ 3 2 ; "_ Th e_ tri pt y ch_ ."_

anyway, her tail catches on fire from the back of the volcano.
any way_ , \ 3 2 ;_ her_ tai l_ cat ches _ on_ fi re_ from_ the_ back_ of_ the_ vo l can o_ ._

I don't know why that happened.
I_ do n_ '_ t_ know_ why_ that_ happen ed_ ._

that happens, you know.
that_ happen s_ , \ 3 2 ;_ you_ know_ ._

her tail terminates in a cycloptic eyeball, made out of 1986 terrorist cards.
her_ tai l_ ter min ate s_ in_ a_ cy cl op tic_ ey e ba ll_ , \ 3 2 ;_ made_ out_ of_ 198 6_ terr ori st_ car ds_ ._

have you guys seen those?
have_ you_ gu ys_ see n_ those_ ?_

they were made in the 1980's, they're like baseball cards of terrorists.
they_ were_ made_ in_ the_ 198 0_ '_ s_ , \ 3 2 ;_ they_ '_ re_ like_ bas e ba ll_ car ds_ of_ terr ori sts _ ._

way ahead of their time.
way_ ah ea d_ of_ their_ time_ ._

that will bring you to my latest project.
that_ will_ bri ng_ you_ to_ my_ late st_ project _ ._

I'm in the middle of two projects: one's called "Psychogeographies."
I_ '_ m_ in_ the_ mi dd le_ of_ two_ project s_ : \ 3 2 ;_ one_ '_ s_ called_ \ 3 2 ; "_ P sy cho ge og rap hi es_ ."_

it's about a six-year project to make 100 of these humans.
it_ '_ s_ about_ a_ si x _ - _ year_ project _ to_ make_ 10 0_ of_ these_ human s_ ._

each one is an archive of our culture, through our ripped-up media and matter, whether it's encyclopedias or dictionaries or magazines.
each_ one_ is_ an_ archi ve_ of_ our_ culture _ , \ 3 2 ;_ through_ our_ ri pp ed_ - _ up_ medi a_ and_ matter _ , \ 3 2 ;_ whe ther_ it_ '_ s_ en cy cl ope di as_ or_ dic tion ar ies_ or_ mag azin es_ ._

but each one acts as a sort of an archive in the shape of a human, and they travel in groups of 20, 4, or 12 at a time.
but_ each_ one_ act s_ as_ a_ sor t_ of_ an_ archi ve_ in_ the_ sha pe_ of_ a_ human_ , \ 3 2 ;_ and_ they_ tra vel _ in_ groups_ of_ 20 _ , \ 3 2 ;_ 4_ , \ 3 2 ;_ or_ 1 2_ at_ a_ time_ ._

they're like cells -- they come together, they divide.
they_ '_ re_ like_ cells _ \ 3 2 ; - - \ 3 2 ;_ they_ come_ together_ , \ 3 2 ;_ they_ div ide _ ._

and you kind of walk through them. it's taking me years.
and_ you_ kind_ of_ wal k_ through_ them_ . \ 3 2 ;_ it_ '_ s_ tak ing_ me_ years_ ._

each one is basically a 3,000-pound microscope slide with a human stuck inside.
each_ one_ is_ bas ically_ a_ 3 _ ,_ 0 0 0_ - _ po und _ micro sc ope _ sl ide _ with_ a_ human_ stu ck_ inside_ ._

this one has a little cave in his chest.
this_ one_ has_ a_ little_ ca ve_ in_ his_ ches t_ ._

that's his head; there's the chest, you can kind of see the beginning.
that_ '_ s_ his_ head _ ; \ 3 2 ;_ there_ '_ s_ the_ ches t_ , \ 3 2 ;_ you_ can_ kind_ of_ see_ the_ beg inn ing_ ._

I'm going to go down the body for you: there's a waterfall coming out of his chest, covering his penis -- or not-penis, or whatever it is, a kind of androgynous thing.
I_ '_ m_ going_ to_ go_ down _ the_ body_ for_ you_ : \ 3 2 ;_ there_ '_ s_ a_ water fall _ com ing_ out_ of_ his_ ches t_ , \ 3 2 ;_ co ver ing_ his_ pe ni s_ \ 3 2 ; - - \ 3 2 ;_ or_ not_ - _ pe ni s_ , \ 3 2 ;_ or_ what ever _ it_ is_ , \ 3 2 ;_ a_ kind_ of_ an dr og y no us_ thing_ ._

I'll take you quickly through these works, because I can't explain them for too long.
I_ '_ ll_ take_ you_ qui ckl y_ through_ these_ work s_ , \ 3 2 ;_ because_ I_ can_ '_ t_ expl ain _ them_ for_ too_ long _ ._

there are the layers, you can kind of see it.
there_ are_ the_ la ye rs_ , \ 3 2 ;_ you_ can_ kind_ of_ see_ it_ ._

that's a body getting split in half.
that_ '_ s_ a_ body_ get ting_ sp lit _ in_ ha lf _ ._

this one has two heads, and it's communicating between the two heads.
this_ one_ has_ two_ head s_ , \ 3 2 ;_ and_ it_ '_ s_ communi cat ing_ between_ the_ two_ head s_ ._

you can see the pills coming out, going into one head from this weird statue.
you_ can_ see_ the_ pi lls_ com ing_ out_ , \ 3 2 ;_ going_ into_ one_ head _ from_ this_ we ird_ sta tu e_ ._

there's a little forest scene inside the chest cavity.
there_ '_ s_ a_ little_ fore st_ sc en e_ inside_ the_ ches t_ ca vi ty_ ._

can you see that?
can_ you_ see_ that_ ?_

anyway, this talk's all about these boxes, like the boxes we're in.
any way_ , \ 3 2 ;_ this_ talk_ '_ s_ all_ about_ these_ box es_ , \ 3 2 ;_ like_ the_ box es_ we_ '_ re_ in_ ._

this box we're in, the solar system is a box.

this brings you to my latest box.

it's a brick box. it's called Pioneer Works.
it_ '_ s_ a_ bri ck_ box_ . \ 3 2 ;_ it_ '_ s_ called_ P ion ee r_ W or ks _ ._

inside of this box is a physicist, a neuroscientist, a painter, a musician, a writer, a radio station, a museum, a school, a publishing arm to disseminate all the content we make there into the world; a garden.
inside_ of_ this_ box_ is_ a_ ph ys ici st_ , \ 3 2 ;_ a_ ne ur os ci enti st_ , \ 3 2 ;_ a_ pain ter _ , \ 3 2 ;_ a_ music ia n_ , \ 3 2 ;_ a_ write r_ , \ 3 2 ;_ a_ radio _ stati on_ , \ 3 2 ;_ a_ mus e um _ , \ 3 2 ;_ a_ sc hoo l_ , \ 3 2 ;_ a_ publish ing_ ar m_ to_ dis se min ate_ all_ the_ con tent _ we_ make_ there_ into_ the_ world_ ; \ 3 2 ;_ a_ ga rd en_ ._

we shake this box up, and all these people kind of start hitting each other like particles.

and I think that's the way you change the world.
and_ I_ think_ that_ '_ s_ the_ way_ you_ change _ the_ world_ ._

you redefine your insides and the box that you're living in.
you_ re def ine _ your_ ins ide s_ and_ the_ box_ that_ you_ '_ re_ livi ng_ in_ ._

and you come together to realize that we're all in this together, that this delusion of difference -- this idea of countries, of borders, of religion -- doesn't work.
and_ you_ come_ together_ to_ real ize _ that_ we_ '_ re_ all_ in_ this_ together_ , \ 3 2 ;_ that_ this_ del us ion_ of_ diff eren ce_ \ 3 2 ; - - \ 3 2 ;_ this_ idea_ of_ cou nt ri es_ , \ 3 2 ;_ of_ bor de rs_ , \ 3 2 ;_ of_ rel ig ion_ \ 3 2 ; - - \ 3 2 ;_ does n_ '_ t_ work_ ._

we're all really made up of the same stuff, in the same box.
we_ '_ re_ all_ really_ made_ up_ of_ the_ same_ stu ff _ , \ 3 2 ;_ in_ the_ same_ box_ ._

and if we don't start exchanging that stuff sweetly and nicely, we're all going to die real soon.

what do you do when you have a headache?

you swallow an aspirin.

it is now a conflict between states and non-state actors.

for example, of the 216 peace agreements signed between 1975 and 2011, 196 of them were between a state and a non-state actor.

Hezbollah offers all of these services and more.

armed groups also seek to win the population over by offering something that the state is not providing: safety and security.

the initial rise of the Taliban in war-torn Afghanistan, or even the beginning of the ascent of ISIS, can be understood also by looking at these groups' efforts to provide security.

but in general, providing social services fills a gap, a governance gap left by the government, and allows these groups to increase their strength and their power.

for example, the 2006 electoral victory of the Palestinian Hamas cannot be understood without acknowledging the group's social work.

we live in a world of states, non-states, and in-between, and the more states are weak, like in the Middle East today, the more non-state actors step in and fill that gap.

this matters for governments, because to counter these groups, they will have to invest more in non-military tools.

filling that governance gap has to be at the center of any sustainable approach.

this also matters very much for peacemaking and peacebuilding.

so in this new contest between states and non-states, military power can win some battles, but it will not give us peace nor stability.

for most of the 20th century, clinicians told one story about what autism is and how it was discovered, but that story turned out to be wrong, and the consequences of it are having a devastating impact on global public health.

this second story tells us everything about how we got here and where we need to go next.

the first story starts with a child psychiatrist at Johns Hopkins Hospital named Leo Kanner.

in 1943, Kanner published a paper describing 11 young patients who seemed to inhabit private worlds, ignoring the people around them, even their own parents.

they could amuse themselves for hours by flapping their hands in front of their faces, but they were panicked by little things like their favorite toy being moved from its usual place without their knowledge.

based on the patients who were brought to his clinic, Kanner speculated that autism is very rare.
bas ed_ on_ the_ patients _ who_ were_ bro ugh t_ to_ his_ clinic _ , \ 3 2 ;_ Kanner _ spec ul ated _ that_ autism_ is_ very_ rar e_ ._

by the 1950s, as the world's leading authority on the subject, he declared that he had seen less than 150 true cases of his syndrome while fielding referrals from as far away as South Africa.

that's actually not surprising, because Kanner's criteria for diagnosing autism were incredibly selective.
that_ '_ s_ act ually_ not_ sur pri si ng_ , \ 3 2 ;_ because_ Kanner _ '_ s_ crit er ia _ for_ diagnos ing_ autism_ were_ incre di bl y_ se lec ti ve_ ._

for example, he discouraged giving the diagnosis to children who had seizures but now we know that epilepsy is very common in autism.

he once bragged that he had turned nine out of 10 kids referred to his office as autistic by other clinicians without giving them an autism diagnosis.

Kanner was a smart guy, but a number of his theories didn't pan out.
Kanner _ was_ a_ sm art _ gu y_ , \ 3 2 ;_ but_ a_ number_ of_ his_ the ori es_ di d n_ '_ t_ pa n_ out_ ._

he classified autism as a form of infantile psychosis caused by cold and unaffectionate parents.
he_ cla ssi fi ed_ autism_ as_ a_ form_ of_ inf ant il e_ psych os is_ cause d_ by_ col d_ and_ una ff ecti on ate_ parents_ ._

these children, he said, had been kept neatly in a refrigerator that didn't defrost.

at the same time, however, Kanner noticed that some of his young patients had special abilities that clustered in certain areas like music, math and memory.

one boy in his clinic could distinguish between 18 symphonies before he turned two.

when his mother put on one of his favorite records, he would correctly declare, "Beethoven!"

but Kanner took a dim view of these abilities, claiming that the kids were just regurgitating things they'd heard their pompous parents say, As a result, autism became a source of shame and stigma for families, and two generations of autistic children were shipped off to institutions for their own good, becoming invisible to the world at large.

amazingly, it wasn't until the 1970s that researchers began to test Kanner's theory that autism was rare.

Lorna Wing was a cognitive psychologist in London who thought that Kanner's theory of refrigerator parenting were "bloody stupid," as she told me.

she and her husband John were warm and affectionate people, and they had a profoundly autistic daughter named Susie.

Lorna and John knew how hard it was to raise a child like Susie without support services, and the other resources that are out of reach without a diagnosis.

to make the case to the National Health Service that more resources were needed for autistic children and their families, Lorna and her colleague Judith Gould decided to do something that should have been done 30 years earlier.

they undertook a study of autism prevalence in the general population.

they pounded the pavement in a London suburb called Camberwell to try to find autistic children in the community.

what they saw made clear that Kanner's model was way too narrow, while the reality of autism was much more colorful and diverse.

some kids couldn't talk at all, while others waxed on at length about their fascination with astrophysics, dinosaurs or the genealogy of royalty.

in other words, these children didn't fit into nice, neat boxes, as Judith put it, and they saw lots of them, way more than Kanner's monolithic model would have predicted.

but then Lorna came upon a reference to a paper that had been published in German in 1944, the year after Kanner's paper, and then forgotten, buried with the ashes of a terrible time that no one wanted to remember or think about.

Kanner knew about this competing paper, It had never even been translated into English, but luckily, Lorna's husband spoke German, and he translated it for her.

the paper offered an alternate story of autism.
the_ paper _ off er ed_ an_ al ter na te_ story_ of_ autism_ ._

its author was a man named Hans Asperger, who ran a combination clinic and residential school in Vienna in the 1930s.

Asperger's ideas about teaching children with learning differences were progressive even by contemporary standards.
As per ger _ '_ s_ idea s_ about_ tea chi ng_ children_ with_ learn ing_ diff eren ces _ were_ pro gre ssi ve_ even_ by_ con tem po rar y_ stand ar ds_ ._

mornings at his clinic began with exercise classes set to music, and the children put on plays on Sunday afternoons.

instead of blaming parents for causing autism, Asperger framed it as a lifelong, polygenetic disability that requires compassionate forms of support and accommodations over the course of one's whole life.

rather than treating the kids in his clinic like patients, Asperger called them his little professors, and enlisted their help in developing methods of education that were particularly suited to them.

crucially, Asperger viewed autism as a diverse continuum that spans an astonishing range of giftedness and disability.

he believed that autism and autistic traits are common and always have been, seeing aspects of this continuum in familiar archetypes from pop culture like the socially awkward scientist and the absent-minded professor.

he went so far as to say, it seems that for success in science and art, a dash of autism is essential.

Lorna and Judith realized that Kanner had been as wrong about autism being rare as he had been about parents causing it.

over the next several years, they quietly worked with the American psychiatric Association to broaden the criteria for diagnosis to reflect the diversity of what they called "the autism spectrum."

in the late '80s and early 1990s, their changes went into effect, swapping out Kanner's narrow model for Asperger's broad and inclusive one.

these changes weren't happening in a vacuum.

by coincidence, as Lorna and Judith worked behind the scenes to reform the criteria, people all over the world were seeing an autistic adult for the first time.

before "Rain Man" came out in 1988, only a tiny, ingrown circle of experts knew what autism looked like, but after Dustin Hoffman's unforgettable performance as Raymond Babbitt earned "Rain Man" four Academy Awards, pediatricians, psychologists, teachers and parents all over the world knew what autism looked like.

coincidentally, at the same time, the first easy-to-use clinical tests for diagnosing autism were introduced.
