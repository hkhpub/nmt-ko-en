We're at a tipping point in human history,  a species poised between gaining the stars and losing the planet we call home.

Even in just the past few years, we've greatly expanded  our knowledge of how Earth fits within the context of our universe.

NASA's Kepler mission has discovered  thousands of potential planets around other stars,  indicating that Earth is but one of billions of planets in our galaxy.

Kepler is a space telescope  that measures the subtle dimming of stars as planets pass in front of them,  blocking just a little bit of that light from reaching us.

Kepler's data reveals planets' sizes  as well as their distance from their parent star.

Together, this helps us understand whether these planets are small and rocky,  like the terrestrial planets in our own Solar System,  and also how much light they receive from their parent sun.

In turn, this provides clues as to whether these planets that we discover  might be habitable or not.

Unfortunately, at the same time as we're discovering this treasure trove  of potentially habitable worlds,  our own planet is sagging under the weight of humanity.

Now, as somebody who is deeply embedded in the search for life in the universe,  I can tell you that the more you look for planets like Earth,  the more you appreciate our own planet itself.

Each one of these new worlds invites a comparison  between the newly discovered planet and the planets we know best:  those of our own Solar System.

Consider our neighbor, Mars.

Mars is small and rocky, and though it's a bit far from the Sun,  it might be considered a potentially habitable world  if found by a mission like Kepler.

Indeed, it's possible that Mars was habitable in the past,  and in part, this is why we study Mars so much.

But though these Martian vistas  resemble the deserts of our own home world,  places that are tied in our imagination to ideas about pioneering and frontiers,  compared to Earth  Mars is a pretty terrible place to live.

I worry -- I worry that this excitement about colonizing Mars and other planets  carries with it a long, dark shadow:  the implication and belief by some  that Mars will be there to save us from the self-inflicted destruction  of the only truly habitable planet we know of, the Earth.

There are many excellent reasons to go to Mars,  but for anyone to tell you that Mars will be there to back up humanity  is like the captain of the Titanic telling you that the real party  is happening later on the lifeboats.

But the goals of interplanetary exploration and planetary preservation  are not opposed to one another.

I leave you with a final thought experiment:  Fermi's paradox.
I_ lea ve_ you_ with_ a_ fin al_ thought_ expe ri ment_ : \ 3 2 ; \ 3 2 ;_ F erm i _ ' _ s_ pa ra do x _ ._

Many years ago, the physicist Enrico Fermi asked that, given the fact  that our universe has been around for a very long time  and we expect that there are many planets within it,  we should have found evidence for alien life by now.
Ma n y_ years_ ago _ , \ 3 2 ;_ the_ ph ys ici st_ E n ri co _ F erm i _ asked_ that_ , \ 3 2 ;_ give n_ the_ fact _ \ 3 2 ; \ 3 2 ;_ that_ our_ uni vers e_ has_ been_ around_ for_ a_ very_ long _ time_ \ 3 2 ; \ 3 2 ;_ and_ we_ expe ct_ that_ there_ are_ many_ planets_ wi thin _ it_ , \ 3 2 ; \ 3 2 ;_ we_ should_ have_ found_ ev ide nce _ for_ ali en_ life_ by_ now_ ._

So where are they?
So_ where_ are_ they_ ?_

Well, one possible solution to Fermi's paradox  is that, as civilizations become technologically advanced enough  to consider living amongst the stars,  they lose sight of how important it is  to safeguard the home worlds that fostered that advancement to begin with.
We ll_ , \ 3 2 ;_ one_ possib le_ sol uti on_ to_ F erm i _ ' _ s_ pa ra do x _ \ 3 2 ; \ 3 2 ;_ is_ that_ , \ 3 2 ;_ as_ ci vi li z ation s_ become_ tec hn ologi cally _ ad va nce d_ en ou gh _ \ 3 2 ; \ 3 2 ;_ to_ consider _ livi ng_ am ong st_ the_ sta rs_ , \ 3 2 ; \ 3 2 ;_ they_ los e_ si ght _ of_ how_ impo rt ant _ it_ is_ \ 3 2 ; \ 3 2 ;_ to_ sa fe gu ar d_ the_ home _ world s_ that_ fo ste red_ that_ ad va nce ment_ to_ beg in_ with_ ._

It is hubris to believe that interplanetary colonization alone  will save us from ourselves,  but planetary preservation and interplanetary exploration  can work together.
It_ is_ hu bri s_ to_ believe_ that_ inter planetary _ colo ni z ation_ alon e_ \ 3 2 ; \ 3 2 ;_ will_ sa ve_ us_ from_ ou rs el ves_ , \ 3 2 ; \ 3 2 ;_ but_ planetary _ pres erv ation_ and_ inter planetary _ expl orat ion_ \ 3 2 ; \ 3 2 ;_ can_ work_ together _ ._

If we truly believe in our ability  to bend the hostile environments of Mars for human habitation,  then we should be able to surmount the far easier task of preserving  the habitability of the Earth.
If_ we_ tru ly_ believe_ in_ our_ abilit y_ \ 3 2 ; \ 3 2 ;_ to_ be nd_ the_ ho sti le_ environment s_ of_ Mars_ for_ human_ ha bit ation_ , \ 3 2 ; \ 3 2 ;_ then_ we_ should_ be_ able_ to_ sur mo un t_ the_ fa r_ eas ie r_ ta s k_ of_ pres erv ing_ \ 3 2 ; \ 3 2 ;_ the_ habitab ili ty_ of_ the_ Earth _ ._

A few years ago, I broke into my own house.
A _ few_ years_ ago _ , \ 3 2 ;_ I_ bro ke_ into_ my_ own_ ho use _ ._

I had just driven home,  it was around midnight in the dead of Montreal winter,  I had been visiting my friend, Jeff, across town,  and the thermometer on the front porch read minus 40 degrees --  and don't bother asking if that's Celsius or Fahrenheit,  minus 40 is where the two scales meet --  it was very cold.
I_ had_ just_ dri ven _ home _ , \ 3 2 ; \ 3 2 ;_ it_ was_ around_ mi d night_ in_ the_ dea d_ of_ M on tre al_ wi nt er_ , \ 3 2 ; \ 3 2 ;_ I_ had_ been_ vis iti ng_ my_ friend _ , \ 3 2 ;_ J e ff _ , \ 3 2 ;_ across_ to w n_ , \ 3 2 ; \ 3 2 ;_ and_ the_ ther mo met er_ on_ the_ front_ po rc h_ read _ min us_ 4 0_ de gre es_ \ 3 2 ; - - \ 3 2 ; \ 3 2 ;_ and_ do n_ ' _ t_ bot her_ ask ing_ if_ that_ ' _ s_ C els i us_ or_ F ah re n he it_ , \ 3 2 ; \ 3 2 ;_ min us_ 4 0_ is_ where_ the_ two_ scale s_ me et_ \ 3 2 ; - - \ 3 2 ; \ 3 2 ;_ it_ was_ very_ col d_ ._

And as I stood on the front porch fumbling in my pockets,  I found I didn't have my keys.
And_ as_ I_ sto od_ on_ the_ front_ po rc h_ fu mbl ing_ in_ my_ po ck et s_ , \ 3 2 ; \ 3 2 ;_ I_ found_ I_ di d n_ ' _ t_ have_ my_ ke ys_ ._

In fact, I could see them through the window,  lying on the dining room table where I had left them.

So I quickly ran around and tried all the other doors and windows,  and they were locked tight.
So_ I_ qui ckl y_ ra n_ around_ and_ tri ed_ all_ the_ other_ do ors _ and_ window s_ , \ 3 2 ; \ 3 2 ;_ and_ they_ were_ lo ck ed_ ti ght _ ._

I thought about calling a locksmith -- at least I had my cellphone,  but at midnight, it could take a while for a locksmith to show up,  and it was cold.
I_ thought_ about_ cal lin g_ a_ lo ck sm ith _ \ 3 2 ; - - \ 3 2 ;_ at_ lea st_ I_ had_ my_ cel l ph one_ , \ 3 2 ; \ 3 2 ;_ but_ at_ mi d night_ , \ 3 2 ;_ it_ could_ take_ a_ while_ for_ a_ lo ck sm ith _ to_ sho w_ up_ , \ 3 2 ; \ 3 2 ;_ and_ it_ was_ col d_ ._

I couldn't go back to my friend Jeff's house for the night  because I had an early flight to Europe the next morning,  and I needed to get my passport and my suitcase.
I_ cou ld n_ ' _ t_ go_ back_ to_ my_ friend _ J e ff _ ' _ s_ ho use _ for_ the_ night_ \ 3 2 ; \ 3 2 ;_ because_ I_ had_ an_ ear ly_ fl ight _ to_ E ur ope _ the_ next_ mor ning _ , \ 3 2 ; \ 3 2 ;_ and_ I_ need ed_ to_ get_ my_ pass port _ and_ my_ su it case _ ._

So, desperate and freezing cold,  I found a large rock and I broke through the basement window,  cleared out the shards of glass,  I crawled through,  I found a piece of cardboard and taped it up over the opening,  figuring that in the morning, on the way to the airport,  I could call my contractor and ask him to fix it.
So_ , \ 3 2 ;_ des per ate_ and_ free z ing_ col d_ , \ 3 2 ; \ 3 2 ;_ I_ found_ a_ large _ ro ck_ and_ I_ bro ke_ through_ the_ ba se ment_ window _ , \ 3 2 ; \ 3 2 ;_ clear ed_ out_ the_ sha rd s_ of_ gl as s_ , \ 3 2 ; \ 3 2 ;_ I_ cr aw led _ through_ , \ 3 2 ; \ 3 2 ;_ I_ found_ a_ piece _ of_ car d bo ar d_ and_ ta pe d_ it_ up_ over_ the_ ope ning _ , \ 3 2 ; \ 3 2 ;_ fi gu ring_ that_ in_ the_ mor ning _ , \ 3 2 ;_ on_ the_ way_ to_ the_ air port _ , \ 3 2 ; \ 3 2 ;_ I_ could_ call_ my_ contr act or_ and_ ask_ hi m_ to_ fi x _ it_ ._

This was going to be expensive,  but probably no more expensive than a middle-of-the-night locksmith,  so I figured, under the circumstances, I was coming out even.
This_ was_ going_ to_ be_ expe ns ive_ , \ 3 2 ; \ 3 2 ;_ but_ pro bab ly_ no_ more_ expe ns ive_ than_ a_ mi d dl e_ - _ of_ - _ the_ - _ night_ lo ck sm ith _ , \ 3 2 ; \ 3 2 ;_ so_ I_ figure d_ , \ 3 2 ;_ under_ the_ ci rc um sta nce s_ , \ 3 2 ;_ I_ was_ com ing_ out_ even_ ._

Now, I'm a neuroscientist by training  and I know a little bit about how the brain performs under stress.
Now_ , \ 3 2 ;_ I_ ' _ m_ a_ ne ur os ci enti st_ by_ tra ini ng_ \ 3 2 ; \ 3 2 ;_ and_ I_ know_ a_ little_ bit_ about_ how_ the_ brain_ per form s_ under_ stre ss_ ._

It releases cortisol that raises your heart rate,  it modulates adrenaline levels  and it clouds your thinking.

So the next morning,  when I woke up on too little sleep,  worrying about the hole in the window,  and a mental note that I had to call my contractor,  and the freezing temperatures,  and the meetings I had upcoming in Europe,  and, you know, with all the cortisol in my brain,  my thinking was cloudy,  but I didn't know it was cloudy because my thinking was cloudy.

And it wasn't until I got to the airport check-in counter,  that I realized I didn't have my passport.
And_ it_ wa s n_ ' _ t_ until _ I_ got_ to_ the_ air port _ che ck_ - _ in_ cou nt er_ , \ 3 2 ; \ 3 2 ;_ that_ I_ realized _ I_ di d n_ ' _ t_ have_ my_ pass port _ ._

So I raced home in the snow and ice, 40 minutes,  got my passport, raced back to the airport,  I made it just in time,  but they had given away my seat to someone else,  so I got stuck in the back of the plane, next to the bathrooms,  in a seat that wouldn't recline, on an eight-hour flight.
So_ I_ ra ce d_ home _ in_ the_ s now_ and_ ic e_ , \ 3 2 ;_ 4 0_ min ut es_ , \ 3 2 ; \ 3 2 ;_ got_ my_ pass port _ , \ 3 2 ;_ ra ce d_ back_ to_ the_ air port _ , \ 3 2 ; \ 3 2 ;_ I_ made_ it_ just_ in_ time_ , \ 3 2 ; \ 3 2 ;_ but_ they_ had_ give n_ away_ my_ sea t_ to_ someone_ els e_ , \ 3 2 ; \ 3 2 ;_ so_ I_ got_ stu ck_ in_ the_ back_ of_ the_ plan e_ , \ 3 2 ;_ next_ to_ the_ ba thr o om s_ , \ 3 2 ; \ 3 2 ;_ in_ a_ sea t_ that_ wo ul d n_ ' _ t_ rec line _ , \ 3 2 ;_ on_ an_ ei ght _ - _ ho ur _ fl ight _ ._

Well, I had a lot of time to think during those eight hours and no sleep.
We ll_ , \ 3 2 ;_ I_ had_ a_ lot_ of_ time_ to_ think_ du ring_ those_ ei ght _ ho ur s_ and_ no_ sl ee p_ ._

And I started wondering, are there things that I can do,  systems that I can put into place,  that will prevent bad things from happening?

I was having dinner with my colleague, Danny Kahneman, the Nobel Prize winner,  and I somewhat embarrassedly told him about having broken my window,  and, you know, forgotten my passport,  and Danny shared with me  that he'd been practicing something called prospective hindsight.

Whenever there's a disaster,  a team of experts come in and they try to figure out what went wrong, right?
Wh en ever_ there_ ' _ s_ a_ dis ast er_ , \ 3 2 ; \ 3 2 ;_ a_ tea m_ of_ expe rt s_ come_ in_ and_ they_ try_ to_ figure _ out_ what_ we nt_ wrong_ , \ 3 2 ;_ right_ ?_

Well, in the pre-mortem, Danny explained,  you look ahead and you try to figure out all the things that could go wrong,  and then you try to figure out what you can do  to prevent those things from happening, or to minimize the damage.
We ll_ , \ 3 2 ;_ in_ the_ pre _ - _ mor tem _ , \ 3 2 ;_ D an n y_ expl ain ed_ , \ 3 2 ; \ 3 2 ;_ you_ look_ ah ead_ and_ you_ try_ to_ figure _ out_ all_ the_ things_ that_ could_ go_ wrong_ , \ 3 2 ; \ 3 2 ;_ and_ then_ you_ try_ to_ figure _ out_ what_ you_ can_ do_ \ 3 2 ; \ 3 2 ;_ to_ prev ent_ those_ things_ from_ happen ing_ , \ 3 2 ;_ or_ to_ min im ize _ the_ da mag e_ ._

So what I want to talk to you about today  are some of the things we can do in the form of a pre-mortem.
So_ what_ I_ want_ to_ talk_ to_ you_ about_ today_ \ 3 2 ; \ 3 2 ;_ are_ some_ of_ the_ things_ we_ can_ do_ in_ the_ form_ of_ a_ pre _ - _ mor tem _ ._

Some of them are obvious, some of them are not so obvious.
So me_ of_ them_ are_ ob vi ous_ , \ 3 2 ;_ some_ of_ them_ are_ not_ so_ ob vi ous_ ._

I'll start with the obvious ones.
I_ ' _ ll_ start _ with_ the_ ob vi ous_ one s_ ._

Around the home, designate a place for things that are easily lost.
Ar ou nd_ the_ home _ , \ 3 2 ;_ design ate_ a_ place_ for_ things_ that_ are_ eas il y_ los t_ ._

Now, this sounds like common sense, and it is,  but there's a lot of science to back this up,  based on the way our spatial memory works.
Now_ , \ 3 2 ;_ this_ sound s_ like_ comm on_ sens e_ , \ 3 2 ;_ and_ it_ is_ , \ 3 2 ; \ 3 2 ;_ but_ there_ ' _ s_ a_ lot_ of_ sci ence_ to_ back_ this_ up_ , \ 3 2 ; \ 3 2 ;_ ba sed _ on_ the_ way_ our_ spa ti al_ me mor y_ work s_ ._

There's a structure in the brain called the hippocampus,  that evolved over tens of thousands of years,  to keep track of the locations of important things --  where the well is, where fish can be found,  that stand of fruit trees,  where the friendly and enemy tribes live.
There_ ' _ s_ a_ structure _ in_ the_ brain_ called_ the_ hi pp oc am pu s_ , \ 3 2 ; \ 3 2 ;_ that_ ev ol ved_ over_ ten s_ of_ thou san ds_ of_ years_ , \ 3 2 ; \ 3 2 ;_ to_ ke ep _ tra ck_ of_ the_ loca tion s_ of_ impo rt ant _ things_ \ 3 2 ; - - \ 3 2 ; \ 3 2 ;_ where_ the_ well _ is_ , \ 3 2 ;_ where_ fi sh_ can_ be_ found_ , \ 3 2 ; \ 3 2 ;_ that_ stand _ of_ fruit _ tree s_ , \ 3 2 ; \ 3 2 ;_ where_ the_ friend ly_ and_ en em y_ tri bes _ live_ ._

The hippocampus is the part of the brain  that in London taxicab drivers becomes enlarged.
The_ hi pp oc am pu s_ is_ the_ part_ of_ the_ brain_ \ 3 2 ; \ 3 2 ;_ that_ in_ Lo nd on_ ta x ica b _ dri vers _ bec ome s_ en large d_ ._

It's the part of the brain that allows squirrels to find their nuts.
It_ ' _ s_ the_ part_ of_ the_ brain_ that_ allow s_ s qui rr els _ to_ find_ their_ nu ts_ ._

And if you're wondering, somebody actually did the experiment  where they cut off the olfactory sense of the squirrels,  and they could still find their nuts.
And_ if_ you_ ' _ re_ wo nd ering _ , \ 3 2 ;_ some body_ act ually_ did_ the_ expe ri ment_ \ 3 2 ; \ 3 2 ;_ where_ they_ cu t_ off _ the_ ol fact ory _ sens e_ of_ the_ s qui rr els _ , \ 3 2 ; \ 3 2 ;_ and_ they_ could_ still_ find_ their_ nu ts_ ._

They weren't using smell, they were using the hippocampus,  this exquisitely evolved mechanism in the brain for finding things.
They_ we re n_ ' _ t_ using_ sm ell _ , \ 3 2 ;_ they_ were_ using_ the_ hi pp oc am pu s_ , \ 3 2 ; \ 3 2 ;_ this_ ex qui site ly_ ev ol ved_ me chan ism _ in_ the_ brain_ for_ fin ding_ things_ ._

But it's really good for things that don't move around much,  not so good for things that move around.
But_ it_ ' _ s_ really_ good_ for_ things_ that_ do n_ ' _ t_ mov e_ around_ much_ , \ 3 2 ; \ 3 2 ;_ not_ so_ good_ for_ things_ that_ mov e_ around_ ._

So this is why we lose car keys and reading glasses and passports.
So_ this_ is_ wh y_ we_ los e_ car _ ke ys_ and_ read ing_ gl asse s_ and_ pass port s_ ._

So in the home, designate a spot for your keys --  a hook by the door, maybe a decorative bowl.
So_ in_ the_ home _ , \ 3 2 ;_ design ate_ a_ spo t_ for_ your_ ke ys_ \ 3 2 ; - - \ 3 2 ; \ 3 2 ;_ a_ hoo k_ by_ the_ do or_ , \ 3 2 ;_ may be_ a_ dec orat ive_ bo w l_ ._

For your passport, a particular drawer.
For_ your_ pass port _ , \ 3 2 ;_ a_ particular _ draw er_ ._

For your reading glasses, a particular table.
For_ your_ read ing_ gl asse s_ , \ 3 2 ;_ a_ particular _ table _ ._

If you designate a spot and you're scrupulous about it,  your things will always be there when you look for them.
If_ you_ design ate_ a_ spo t_ and_ you_ ' _ re_ sc ru pu lo us_ about_ it_ , \ 3 2 ; \ 3 2 ;_ your_ things_ will_ always_ be_ there_ when_ you_ look_ for_ them_ ._

What about travel?
What_ about_ tra vel _ ?_

Take a cell phone picture of your credit cards,  your driver's license, your passport,  mail it to yourself so it's in the cloud.
T ake _ a_ cel l_ ph one_ pi ct ure_ of_ your_ cre di t_ car ds_ , \ 3 2 ; \ 3 2 ;_ your_ dri ver _ ' _ s_ lic en se_ , \ 3 2 ;_ your_ pass port _ , \ 3 2 ; \ 3 2 ;_ mai l_ it_ to_ you rs el f _ so_ it_ ' _ s_ in_ the_ cloud _ ._

If these things are lost or stolen, you can facilitate replacement.
If_ these_ things_ are_ los t_ or_ sto len _ , \ 3 2 ;_ you_ can_ fa ci lit ate_ rep la ce ment_ ._

Now these are some rather obvious things.
Now_ these_ are_ some_ rat her_ ob vi ous_ things_ ._

Remember, when you're under stress, the brain releases cortisol.
R eme mber _ , \ 3 2 ;_ when_ you_ ' _ re_ under_ stre ss_ , \ 3 2 ;_ the_ brain_ rel eas es_ cor ti sol _ ._

Cortisol is toxic, and it causes cloudy thinking.
Co rt is ol _ is_ to x ic_ , \ 3 2 ;_ and_ it_ cause s_ cloud y_ thinking_ ._

So part of the practice of the pre-mortem  is to recognize that under stress you're not going to be at your best,  and you should put systems in place.
So_ part_ of_ the_ pr acti ce_ of_ the_ pre _ - _ mor tem _ \ 3 2 ; \ 3 2 ;_ is_ to_ rec og ni ze _ that_ under_ stre ss_ you_ ' _ re_ not_ going_ to_ be_ at_ your_ bes t_ , \ 3 2 ; \ 3 2 ;_ and_ you_ should_ put_ system s_ in_ place_ ._

And there's perhaps no more stressful a situation  than when you're confronted with a medical decision to make.
And_ there_ ' _ s_ per ha p s_ no_ more_ stre ss ful_ a_ si tu ation_ \ 3 2 ; \ 3 2 ;_ than_ when_ you_ ' _ re_ conf ron ted_ with_ a_ medical_ deci sion _ to_ make_ ._

And at some point, all of us are going to be in that position,  where we have to make a very important decision  about the future of our medical care or that of a loved one,  to help them with a decision.
And_ at_ some_ point _ , \ 3 2 ;_ all_ of_ us_ are_ going_ to_ be_ in_ that_ pos ition _ , \ 3 2 ; \ 3 2 ;_ where_ we_ have_ to_ make_ a_ very_ impo rt ant _ deci sion _ \ 3 2 ; \ 3 2 ;_ about_ the_ fu ture _ of_ our_ medical_ care _ or_ that_ of_ a_ love d_ one_ , \ 3 2 ; \ 3 2 ;_ to_ help_ them_ with_ a_ deci sion _ ._

And so I want to talk about that.
And_ so_ I_ want_ to_ talk_ about_ that_ ._

And I'm going to talk about a very particular medical condition.
And_ I_ ' _ m_ going_ to_ talk_ about_ a_ very_ particular _ medical_ con di tion_ ._

But this stands as a proxy for all kinds of medical decision-making,  and indeed for financial decision-making, and social decision-making --  any kind of decision you have to make  that would benefit from a rational assessment of the facts.
But_ this_ stand s_ as_ a_ pro x y_ for_ all_ ki nds _ of_ medical_ deci sion _ - _ ma king_ , \ 3 2 ; \ 3 2 ;_ and_ ind ee d_ for_ fin anc ial _ deci sion _ - _ ma king_ , \ 3 2 ;_ and_ social_ deci sion _ - _ ma king_ \ 3 2 ; - - \ 3 2 ; \ 3 2 ;_ any_ kind_ of_ deci sion _ you_ have_ to_ make_ \ 3 2 ; \ 3 2 ;_ that_ would_ be ne fi t_ from_ a_ rati on al_ asse ss ment_ of_ the_ fact s_ ._

So suppose you go to your doctor and the doctor says,  "I just got your lab work back, your cholesterol's a little high."
So_ suppo se_ you_ go_ to_ your_ doct or_ and_ the_ doct or_ say s_ , \ 3 2 ; \ 3 2 ; "_ I_ just_ got_ your_ lab _ work_ back_ , \ 3 2 ;_ your_ cho les ter ol _ ' _ s_ a_ little_ high _ ."_

Now, you all know that high cholesterol  is associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular disease,  heart attack, stroke.
Now_ , \ 3 2 ;_ you_ all_ know_ that_ high _ cho les ter ol _ \ 3 2 ; \ 3 2 ;_ is_ as soci ated _ with_ an_ incre ase d_ ris k_ of_ car di ov as cul ar_ disease _ , \ 3 2 ; \ 3 2 ;_ hear t_ att ac k_ , \ 3 2 ;_ str o ke_ ._

And so you're thinking  having high cholesterol isn't the best thing,  and so the doctor says, "You know, I'd like to give you a drug  that will help you lower your cholesterol, a statin."
And_ so_ you_ ' _ re_ thinking_ \ 3 2 ; \ 3 2 ;_ havi ng_ high _ cho les ter ol _ isn _ ' _ t_ the_ bes t_ thing_ , \ 3 2 ; \ 3 2 ;_ and_ so_ the_ doct or_ say s_ , \ 3 2 ; "_ You_ know_ , \ 3 2 ;_ I_ ' _ d_ like_ to_ give _ you_ a_ drug _ \ 3 2 ; \ 3 2 ;_ that_ will_ help_ you_ low er_ your_ cho les ter ol _ , \ 3 2 ;_ a_ stati n_ ."_

And you've probably heard of statins,  you know that they're among the most widely prescribed drugs  you probably even know people who take them.
And_ you_ ' _ ve_ pro bab ly_ hear d_ of_ stati ns_ , \ 3 2 ; \ 3 2 ;_ you_ know_ that_ they_ ' _ re_ am ong _ the_ most_ wi del y_ pres cr ib ed_ drugs_ \ 3 2 ; \ 3 2 ;_ you_ pro bab ly_ even_ know_ people_ who_ take_ them_ ._

And so you're thinking, "Yeah! Give me the statin."
And_ so_ you_ ' _ re_ thinking_ , \ 3 2 ; "_ Y ea h_ ! \ 3 2 ;_ G ive_ me_ the_ stati n_ ."_

But there's a question you should ask at this point,  a statistic you should ask for  that most doctors don't like talking about,  and pharmaceutical companies like talking about even less.
But_ there_ ' _ s_ a_ question_ you_ should_ ask_ at_ this_ point _ , \ 3 2 ; \ 3 2 ;_ a_ stati stic _ you_ should_ ask_ for_ \ 3 2 ; \ 3 2 ;_ that_ most_ doct ors _ do n_ ' _ t_ like_ tal king_ about_ , \ 3 2 ; \ 3 2 ;_ and_ ph ar ma ce uti cal _ compa ni es_ like_ tal king_ about_ even_ less _ ._

It's for the number needed to treat.
It_ ' _ s_ for_ the_ number_ need ed_ to_ treat _ ._

Now, what is this, the NNT?
Now_ , \ 3 2 ;_ what_ is_ this_ , \ 3 2 ;_ the_ N N T _ ?_

It's the number of people that need to take a drug  or undergo a surgery or any medical procedure  before one person is helped.
It_ ' _ s_ the_ number_ of_ people_ that_ need_ to_ take_ a_ drug _ \ 3 2 ; \ 3 2 ;_ or_ under go_ a_ sur ger y_ or_ any_ medical_ pro ce du re_ \ 3 2 ; \ 3 2 ;_ before_ one_ person _ is_ help ed_ ._

And you're thinking, what kind of crazy statistic is that?
And_ you_ ' _ re_ thinking_ , \ 3 2 ;_ what_ kind_ of_ cr a z y_ stati stic _ is_ that_ ?_

The number should be one.
The_ number_ should_ be_ one_ ._

My doctor wouldn't prescribe something to me  if it's not going to help.
M y_ doct or_ wo ul d n_ ' _ t_ pres cr ib e_ something_ to_ me_ \ 3 2 ; \ 3 2 ;_ if_ it_ ' _ s_ not_ going_ to_ help_ ._

But actually, medical practice doesn't work that way.
But_ act ually_ , \ 3 2 ;_ medical_ pr acti ce_ does n_ ' _ t_ work_ that_ way_ ._

And it's not the doctor's fault,  if it's anybody's fault, it's the fault of scientists like me.
And_ it_ ' _ s_ not_ the_ doct or_ ' _ s_ fa ult _ , \ 3 2 ; \ 3 2 ;_ if_ it_ ' _ s_ any body_ ' _ s_ fa ult _ , \ 3 2 ;_ it_ ' _ s_ the_ fa ult _ of_ scientist s_ like_ me_ ._

We haven't figured out the underlying mechanisms well enough.

But GlaxoSmithKline estimates  that 90 percent of the drugs work in only 30 to 50 percent of the people.
But_ G la x o S mi th K line _ esti mat es_ \ 3 2 ; \ 3 2 ;_ that_ 9 0_ percent _ of_ the_ drugs_ work_ in_ only_ 30 _ to_ 50 _ percent _ of_ the_ people_ ._

So the number needed to treat for the most widely prescribed statin,  what do you suppose it is?
So_ the_ number_ need ed_ to_ treat _ for_ the_ most_ wi del y_ pres cr ib ed_ stati n_ , \ 3 2 ; \ 3 2 ;_ what_ do_ you_ suppo se_ it_ is_ ?_

How many people have to take it before one person is helped?
How _ many_ people_ have_ to_ take_ it_ before_ one_ person _ is_ help ed_ ?_

300.
30 0_ ._

This is according to research  by research practitioners Jerome Groopman and Pamela Hartzband,  I ran through the numbers myself.
This_ is_ acco rd ing_ to_ research _ \ 3 2 ; \ 3 2 ;_ by_ research _ pr acti tion ers_ J er ome _ G ro op man _ and_ P ame la _ Ha rt z ba nd_ , \ 3 2 ; \ 3 2 ;_ I_ ra n_ through_ the_ nu mber s_ myself_ ._

300 people have to take the drug for a year  before one heart attack, stroke or other adverse event is prevented.
30 0_ people_ have_ to_ take_ the_ drug _ for_ a_ year_ \ 3 2 ; \ 3 2 ;_ before_ one_ hear t_ att ac k_ , \ 3 2 ;_ str o ke_ or_ other_ ad vers e_ eve nt_ is_ prev ent ed_ ._

Now you're probably thinking,  "Well, OK, one in 300 chance of lowering my cholesterol.
Now_ you_ ' _ re_ pro bab ly_ thinking_ , \ 3 2 ; \ 3 2 ; "_ We ll_ , \ 3 2 ;_ O K _ , \ 3 2 ;_ one_ in_ 30 0_ chan ce_ of_ low ering _ my_ cho les ter ol _ ._

Why not, doc? Give me the prescription anyway."
Wh y_ not_ , \ 3 2 ;_ do c_ ? \ 3 2 ;_ G ive_ me_ the_ pres cr i pt ion_ any way_ ."_

But you should ask at this point for another statistic,  and that is, "Tell me about the side effects." Right?
But_ you_ should_ ask_ at_ this_ point _ for_ another_ stati stic _ , \ 3 2 ; \ 3 2 ;_ and_ that_ is_ , \ 3 2 ; "_ T ell _ me_ about_ the_ side_ effect s_ . " \ 3 2 ;_ R ight _ ?_

So for this particular drug,  the side effects occur in five percent of the patients.
So_ for_ this_ particular _ drug _ , \ 3 2 ; \ 3 2 ;_ the_ side_ effect s_ oc cur _ in_ fi ve_ percent _ of_ the_ patients _ ._

And they include terrible things --  debilitating muscle and joint pain, gastrointestinal distress --  but now you're thinking, "Five percent,  not very likely it's going to happen to me,  I'll still take the drug."
And_ they_ inclu de_ terr ible_ things_ \ 3 2 ; - - \ 3 2 ; \ 3 2 ;_ de bil it ati ng_ mus cle _ and_ j oi nt_ pain _ , \ 3 2 ;_ ga str oi nt esti na l_ dist ress _ \ 3 2 ; - - \ 3 2 ; \ 3 2 ;_ but_ now_ you_ ' _ re_ thinking_ , \ 3 2 ; "_ F ive_ percent _ , \ 3 2 ; \ 3 2 ;_ not_ very_ like ly_ it_ ' _ s_ going_ to_ happen _ to_ me_ , \ 3 2 ; \ 3 2 ;_ I_ ' _ ll_ still_ take_ the_ drug _ ."_

But wait a minute.
But_ wa it_ a_ min ut e_ ._

Remember under stress you're not thinking clearly.
R eme mber _ under_ stre ss_ you_ ' _ re_ not_ thinking_ clear ly_ ._

So think about how you're going to work through this ahead of time,  so you don't have to manufacture the chain of reasoning on the spot.
So_ think_ about_ how_ you_ ' _ re_ going_ to_ work_ through_ this_ ah ead_ of_ time_ , \ 3 2 ; \ 3 2 ;_ so_ you_ do n_ ' _ t_ have_ to_ man u fact ure_ the_ ch ain _ of_ reason ing_ on_ the_ spo t_ ._

300 people take the drug, right? One person's helped,  five percent of those 300 have side effects,  that's 15 people.
30 0_ people_ take_ the_ drug _ , \ 3 2 ;_ right_ ? \ 3 2 ;_ One_ person _ ' _ s_ help ed_ , \ 3 2 ; \ 3 2 ;_ fi ve_ percent _ of_ those_ 30 0_ have_ side_ effect s_ , \ 3 2 ; \ 3 2 ;_ that_ ' _ s_ 1 5 _ people_ ._

You're 15 times more likely to be harmed by the drug  than you are to be helped by the drug.
You_ ' _ re_ 1 5 _ time s_ more_ like ly_ to_ be_ ha r med_ by_ the_ drug _ \ 3 2 ; \ 3 2 ;_ than_ you_ are_ to_ be_ help ed_ by_ the_ drug _ ._

Now, I'm not saying whether you should take the statin or not.
Now_ , \ 3 2 ;_ I_ ' _ m_ not_ say ing_ whe ther_ you_ should_ take_ the_ stati n_ or_ not_ ._

I'm just saying you should have this conversation with your doctor.
I_ ' _ m_ just_ say ing_ you_ should_ have_ this_ con vers ation_ with_ your_ doct or_ ._

Medical ethics requires it,  it's part of the principle of informed consent.
M edi cal _ et hi c s_ re qui res _ it_ , \ 3 2 ; \ 3 2 ;_ it_ ' _ s_ part_ of_ the_ pr inc i ple _ of_ inf or med_ cons ent_ ._

You have the right to have access to this kind of information  to begin the conversation about whether you want to take the risks or not.
You_ have_ the_ right_ to_ have_ acce ss_ to_ this_ kind_ of_ inf or mat ion_ \ 3 2 ; \ 3 2 ;_ to_ beg in_ the_ con vers ation_ about_ whe ther_ you_ want_ to_ take_ the_ ris ks _ or_ not_ ._

Now you might be thinking  I've pulled this number out of the air for shock value,  but in fact it's rather typical, this number needed to treat.
Now_ you_ might_ be_ thinking_ \ 3 2 ; \ 3 2 ;_ I_ ' _ ve_ pu ll ed_ this_ number_ out_ of_ the_ air _ for_ sho ck_ va lu e_ , \ 3 2 ; \ 3 2 ;_ but_ in_ fact _ it_ ' _ s_ rat her_ ty pi cal _ , \ 3 2 ;_ this_ number_ need ed_ to_ treat _ ._

For the most widely performed surgery on men over the age of 50,  removal of the prostate for cancer,  the number needed to treat is 49.
For_ the_ most_ wi del y_ per form ed_ sur ger y_ on_ men _ over_ the_ age_ of_ 50 _ , \ 3 2 ; \ 3 2 ;_ rem ov al_ of_ the_ pro state _ for_ can cer _ , \ 3 2 ; \ 3 2 ;_ the_ number_ need ed_ to_ treat _ is_ 4 9 _ ._

That's right, 49 surgeries are done for every one person who's helped.
Th at_ ' _ s_ right_ , \ 3 2 ;_ 4 9 _ sur ger ies_ are_ do ne_ for_ every_ one_ person _ who_ ' _ s_ help ed_ ._

And the side effects in that case occur in 50 percent of the patients.
And_ the_ side_ effect s_ in_ that_ case _ oc cur _ in_ 50 _ percent _ of_ the_ patients _ ._

They include impotence, erectile dysfunction,  urinary incontinence, rectal tearing,  fecal incontinence.
They_ inclu de_ impo ten ce_ , \ 3 2 ;_ ere cti le_ d ys function _ , \ 3 2 ; \ 3 2 ;_ uri na ry_ inc on tin ence_ , \ 3 2 ;_ rect al_ tea ring_ , \ 3 2 ; \ 3 2 ;_ fe cal _ inc on tin ence_ ._

And if you're lucky, and you're one of the 50 percent who has these,  they'll only last for a year or two.
And_ if_ you_ ' _ re_ lu ck y_ , \ 3 2 ;_ and_ you_ ' _ re_ one_ of_ the_ 50 _ percent _ who_ has_ these_ , \ 3 2 ; \ 3 2 ;_ they_ ' _ ll_ only_ last_ for_ a_ year_ or_ two_ ._

So the idea of the pre-mortem is to think ahead of time to the questions that you might be able to ask  that will push the conversation forward.
So_ the_ idea_ of_ the_ pre _ - _ mor tem _ is_ to_ think_ ah ead_ of_ time_ to_ the_ questions_ that_ you_ might_ be_ able_ to_ ask_ \ 3 2 ; \ 3 2 ;_ that_ will_ pu sh_ the_ con vers ation_ for ward _ ._

You don't want to have to manufacture all of this on the spot.
You_ do n_ ' _ t_ want_ to_ have_ to_ man u fact ure_ all_ of_ this_ on_ the_ spo t_ ._

And you also want to think about things like quality of life.
And_ you_ also_ want_ to_ think_ about_ things_ like_ q ual ity_ of_ life_ ._

Because you have a choice oftentimes,  do you I want a shorter life that's pain-free,  or a longer life that might have a great deal of pain towards the end?
Be cause _ you_ have_ a_ choice _ of tent imes_ , \ 3 2 ; \ 3 2 ;_ do_ you_ I_ want_ a_ sho rt er_ life_ that_ ' _ s_ pain _ - _ free _ , \ 3 2 ; \ 3 2 ;_ or_ a_ long er_ life_ that_ might_ have_ a_ gre at_ dea l_ of_ pain _ to ward s_ the_ end _ ?_

These are things to talk about and think about now,  with your family and your loved ones.
These_ are_ things_ to_ talk_ about_ and_ think_ about_ now_ , \ 3 2 ; \ 3 2 ;_ with_ your_ fa mil y_ and_ your_ love d_ one s_ ._

You might change your mind in the heat of the moment,  but at least you're practiced with this kind of thinking.
You_ might_ change _ your_ min d_ in_ the_ hea t_ of_ the_ mo ment_ , \ 3 2 ; \ 3 2 ;_ but_ at_ lea st_ you_ ' _ re_ pr acti ce d_ with_ this_ kind_ of_ thinking_ ._

Remember, our brain under stress releases cortisol,  and one of the things that happens at that moment  is a whole bunch on systems shut down.
R eme mber _ , \ 3 2 ;_ our_ brain_ under_ stre ss_ rel eas es_ cor ti sol _ , \ 3 2 ; \ 3 2 ;_ and_ one_ of_ the_ things_ that_ happen s_ at_ that_ mo ment_ \ 3 2 ; \ 3 2 ;_ is_ a_ who le_ bu nc h_ on_ system s_ s hu t_ down _ ._

There's an evolutionary reason for this.
There_ ' _ s_ an_ ev olution ar y_ reason _ for_ this_ ._

Face-to-face with a predator, you don't need your digestive system,  or your libido, or your immune system,  because if you're body is expending metabolism on those things  and you don't react quickly,  you might become the lion's lunch, and then none of those things matter.
F ac e_ - _ to_ - _ face _ with_ a_ pre da to r_ , \ 3 2 ;_ you_ do n_ ' _ t_ need_ your_ di ge sti ve_ system _ , \ 3 2 ; \ 3 2 ;_ or_ your_ li bi do_ , \ 3 2 ;_ or_ your_ im m un e_ system _ , \ 3 2 ; \ 3 2 ;_ because_ if_ you_ ' _ re_ body_ is_ expe nd ing_ met ab ol ism _ on_ those_ things_ \ 3 2 ; \ 3 2 ;_ and_ you_ do n_ ' _ t_ re act _ qui ckl y_ , \ 3 2 ; \ 3 2 ;_ you_ might_ become_ the_ lion _ ' _ s_ lu nc h_ , \ 3 2 ;_ and_ then_ non e_ of_ those_ things_ matter _ ._

Unfortunately,  one of the things that goes out the window during those times of stress  is rational, logical thinking,  as Danny Kahneman and his colleagues have shown.
U n for tu nat el y_ , \ 3 2 ; \ 3 2 ;_ one_ of_ the_ things_ that_ go es_ out_ the_ window _ du ring_ those_ time s_ of_ stre ss_ \ 3 2 ; \ 3 2 ;_ is_ rati on al_ , \ 3 2 ;_ lo gi cal _ thinking_ , \ 3 2 ; \ 3 2 ;_ as_ D an n y_ K ah ne man _ and_ his_ colle ag ue s_ have_ sho w n_ ._

So we need to train ourselves to think ahead  to these kinds of situations.
So_ we_ need_ to_ tra in_ ou rs el ves_ to_ think_ ah ead_ \ 3 2 ; \ 3 2 ;_ to_ these_ ki nds _ of_ si tu ation s_ ._

I think the important point here is recognizing that all of us are flawed.
I_ think_ the_ impo rt ant _ point _ here_ is_ rec og ni z ing_ that_ all_ of_ us_ are_ fl aw ed_ ._

We all are going to fail now and then.

The idea is to think ahead to what those failures might be,  to put systems in place that will help minimize the damage,  or to prevent the bad things from happening in the first place.

Getting back to that snowy night in Montreal,  when I got back from my trip,  I had my contractor install a combination lock next to the door,  with a key to the front door in it, an easy to remember combination.

And I have to admit,  I still have piles of mail that haven't been sorted,  and piles of emails that I haven't gone through.

So I'm not completely organized,  but I see organization as a gradual process,  and I'm getting there.

Thank you very much.

Interpreter: Piano, "p," is my favorite musical symbol.
In ter pre ter _ : \ 3 2 ;_ P ia no_ , \ 3 2 ; "_ p_ , " \ 3 2 ;_ is_ my_ fa vo rit e_ music al_ sy m bo l_ ._

It means to play softly.

This is my drawing of a p-tree,  which demonstrates  no matter how many thousands upon thousands of p's there may be,  you'll never reach complete silence.

That's my current definition of silence:  a very obscure sound.

I'd like to share a little bit  about the history of American Sign Language, ASL,  plus a bit of my own background. French sign language was brought to America during the early 1800s,  and as time went by, mixed with local signs,  it evolved into the language we know today as ASL.
I_ ' _ d_ like_ to_ sha re_ a_ little_ bit_ \ 3 2 ; \ 3 2 ;_ about_ the_ hi story_ of_ A mer ica n_ S ig n_ L an gu age_ , \ 3 2 ;_ ASL_ , \ 3 2 ; \ 3 2 ;_ pl us_ a_ bit_ of_ my_ own_ back gr ou nd_ . \ 3 2 ;_ F re nc h_ sign_ lang ua ge_ was_ bro ugh t_ to_ A mer ica _ du ring_ the_ ear ly_ 1 8 00 s_ , \ 3 2 ; \ 3 2 ;_ and_ as_ time_ we nt_ by_ , \ 3 2 ;_ mi x ed_ with_ loca l_ si g ns_ , \ 3 2 ; \ 3 2 ;_ it_ ev ol ved_ into_ the_ lang ua ge_ we_ know_ today_ as_ ASL_ ._

So it has a history of about 200 years.
So_ it_ has_ a_ hi story_ of_ about_ 20 0_ years_ ._

I was born deaf,  and I was taught to believe that sound wasn't a part of my life.
I_ was_ bor n_ dea f _ , \ 3 2 ; \ 3 2 ;_ and_ I_ was_ ta ugh t_ to_ believe_ that_ sound_ wa s n_ ' _ t_ a_ part_ of_ my_ life_ ._

And I believed it to be true.
And_ I_ be lie ved_ it_ to_ be_ true _ ._

Yet, I realize now that that wasn't the case at all.
Y et_ , \ 3 2 ;_ I_ real ize _ now_ that_ that_ wa s n_ ' _ t_ the_ case _ at_ all_ ._

Sound was very much a part of my life,  really, on my mind every day.
So und _ was_ very_ much_ a_ part_ of_ my_ life_ , \ 3 2 ; \ 3 2 ;_ really_ , \ 3 2 ;_ on_ my_ min d_ every_ day _ ._

As a Deaf person living in a world of sound,  it's as if I was living in a foreign country,  blindly following its rules, customs, behaviors and norms without ever questioning them.
As_ a_ D ea f _ person _ livi ng_ in_ a_ world_ of_ sound_ , \ 3 2 ; \ 3 2 ;_ it_ ' _ s_ as_ if_ I_ was_ livi ng_ in_ a_ fore ig n_ cou nt ry_ , \ 3 2 ; \ 3 2 ;_ bl ind ly_ fol low ing_ its_ ru les_ , \ 3 2 ;_ cus to ms_ , \ 3 2 ;_ be havi ors _ and_ nor ms_ without_ ever_ question ing_ them_ ._

So how is it that I understand sound?
So_ how_ is_ it_ that_ I_ understand_ sound_ ?_

Well, I watch how people behave and respond to sound.
We ll_ , \ 3 2 ;_ I_ wa t ch_ how_ people_ be have_ and_ res po nd_ to_ sound_ ._

You people are like my loudspeakers, and amplify sound.
You_ people_ are_ like_ my_ lo ud spe ake rs_ , \ 3 2 ;_ and_ am pl ify _ sound_ ._

I learn and mirror that behavior.
I_ learn _ and_ mi rr or_ that_ be havi or_ ._

At the same time, I've learned that I create sound,  and I've seen how people respond to me.
A t_ the_ same_ time_ , \ 3 2 ;_ I_ ' _ ve_ learned_ that_ I_ create_ sound_ , \ 3 2 ; \ 3 2 ;_ and_ I_ ' _ ve_ see n_ how_ people_ res po nd_ to_ me_ ._

Thus I've learned, for example ...
Th us_ I_ ' _ ve_ learned_ , \ 3 2 ;_ for_ ex am ple _ \ 3 2 ; . . ._

"Don't slam the door!"
"_ D on_ ' _ t_ sl am_ the_ do or_ ! "_

"Don't make too much noise when you're eating from the potato-chip bag!"
"_ D on_ ' _ t_ make_ too_ much_ no is e_ when_ you_ ' _ re_ ea ting_ from_ the_ po ta to_ - _ chi p_ ba g_ ! "_

"Don't burp, and when you're eating,  make sure you don't scrape your utensils on the plate."
"_ D on_ ' _ t_ bu r p_ , \ 3 2 ;_ and_ when_ you_ ' _ re_ ea ting_ , \ 3 2 ; \ 3 2 ;_ make_ sur e_ you_ do n_ ' _ t_ sc rap e_ your_ ut en sil s_ on_ the_ pl ate_ ."_

All of these things I term "sound etiquette."
Al l_ of_ these_ things_ I_ ter m_ \ 3 2 ; "_ sound_ eti que tte _ ."_

Maybe I think about sound etiquette  more than the average hearing person does.
Ma y be_ I_ think_ about_ sound_ eti que tte _ \ 3 2 ; \ 3 2 ;_ more_ than_ the_ a ver age_ hear ing_ person _ does _ ._

I'm hyper-vigilant around sound.
I_ ' _ m_ h y per _ - _ vi gi lan t_ around_ sound_ ._

And I'm always waiting in eager nervous anticipation  around sound, about what's to come next.
And_ I_ ' _ m_ always_ wa iti ng_ in_ ea ger _ ner vo us_ ant ici pat ion_ \ 3 2 ; \ 3 2 ;_ around_ sound_ , \ 3 2 ;_ about_ what_ ' _ s_ to_ come_ next_ ._

Hence, this drawing.

And you notice the staff --  there are no notes contained in the lines.
And_ you_ noti ce_ the_ sta ff _ \ 3 2 ; - - \ 3 2 ; \ 3 2 ;_ there_ are_ no_ not es_ conta ine d_ in_ the_ line s_ ._

That's because the lines already contain sound  through the subtle smudges and smears.

In Deaf culture, movement is equivalent to sound.

That's why you'll notice in my drawings, I stick to four lines on paper.

In the year 2008, I had the opportunity to travel to Berlin, Germany,  for an artist residency there.
In_ the_ year_ 20 0 8 _ , \ 3 2 ;_ I_ had_ the_ op port uni ty_ to_ tra vel _ to_ Be r lin _ , \ 3 2 ;_ G erm any_ , \ 3 2 ; \ 3 2 ;_ for_ an_ art ist _ resi den cy _ there_ ._

Prior to this time, I had been working as a painter.
P ri or_ to_ this_ time_ , \ 3 2 ;_ I_ had_ been_ work ing_ as_ a_ pain ter _ ._

During this summer, I visited different museums and gallery spaces,  and as I went from one place to the next,  I noticed there was no visual art there.
D uri ng_ this_ su mm er_ , \ 3 2 ;_ I_ vis ite d_ different_ mus e um s_ and_ ga ll er y_ spa ces _ , \ 3 2 ; \ 3 2 ;_ and_ as_ I_ we nt_ from_ one_ place_ to_ the_ next_ , \ 3 2 ; \ 3 2 ;_ I_ noti ce d_ there_ was_ no_ visual _ art _ there_ ._

At that time, sound was trending, and this struck me ...
A t_ that_ time_ , \ 3 2 ;_ sound_ was_ tre nd ing_ , \ 3 2 ;_ and_ this_ str uc k_ me_ \ 3 2 ; . . ._

there was no visual art,  everything was auditory.
there_ was_ no_ visual _ art _ , \ 3 2 ; \ 3 2 ;_ everything_ was_ a ud it ory _ ._

Now sound has come into my art territory.
Now_ sound_ has_ come_ into_ my_ art _ terr it ory _ ._

Is it going to further distance me from art?
I s_ it_ going_ to_ fu rt her_ dist ance_ me_ from_ art _ ?_

I realized that doesn't have to be the case at all.
I_ realized _ that_ does n_ ' _ t_ have_ to_ be_ the_ case _ at_ all_ ._

I actually know sound.
I_ act ually_ know_ sound_ ._

I know it so well  that it doesn't have to be something just experienced through the ears.
I_ know_ it_ so_ well _ \ 3 2 ; \ 3 2 ;_ that_ it_ does n_ ' _ t_ have_ to_ be_ something_ just_ experience d_ through_ the_ ear s_ ._

It could be felt tactually,  or experienced as a visual,  And everything that I had been taught regarding sound,  I decided to do away with and unlearn.
It_ could_ be_ fe lt _ ta ct ually_ , \ 3 2 ; \ 3 2 ;_ or_ experience d_ as_ a_ visual _ , \ 3 2 ; \ 3 2 ;_ And_ everything_ that_ I_ had_ been_ ta ugh t_ re ga rd ing_ sound_ , \ 3 2 ; \ 3 2 ;_ I_ deci ded _ to_ do_ away_ with_ and_ un learn _ ._

I started creating a new body of work.
I_ started_ creati ng_ a_ new_ body_ of_ work_ ._

And when I presented this to the art community,  I was blown away with the amount of support and attention I received.
And_ when_ I_ pres ent ed_ this_ to_ the_ art _ communi ty_ , \ 3 2 ; \ 3 2 ;_ I_ was_ blo w n_ away_ with_ the_ am ou nt_ of_ suppo rt_ and_ att enti on_ I_ rec ei ved_ ._

I realized:  power, control --  social currency.
I_ realized _ : \ 3 2 ; \ 3 2 ;_ power_ , \ 3 2 ;_ contr ol _ \ 3 2 ; - - \ 3 2 ; \ 3 2 ;_ social_ curren cy _ ._

In the back of my mind, I've always felt that sound was your thing,  a hearing person's thing.
In_ the_ back_ of_ my_ min d_ , \ 3 2 ;_ I_ ' _ ve_ always_ fe lt _ that_ sound_ was_ your_ thing_ , \ 3 2 ; \ 3 2 ;_ a_ hear ing_ person _ ' _ s_ thing_ ._

And sound is so powerful  that it could either disempower me and my artwork,  or it could empower me.
And_ sound_ is_ so_ power ful_ \ 3 2 ; \ 3 2 ;_ that_ it_ could_ ei ther_ dis em power_ me_ and_ my_ art work_ , \ 3 2 ; \ 3 2 ;_ or_ it_ could_ em power_ me_ ._

I chose to be empowered.
I_ cho se_ to_ be_ em power ed_ ._

There's a massive culture around spoken language.
There_ ' _ s_ a_ mas si ve_ culture _ around_ spo ke n_ lang ua ge_ ._

And just because I don't use my literal voice to communicate,  in society's eyes it's as if I don't have a voice at all.
And_ just_ because_ I_ do n_ ' _ t_ use _ my_ lit er al_ voice _ to_ communi cat e_ , \ 3 2 ; \ 3 2 ;_ in_ soci et y_ ' _ s_ ey es_ it_ ' _ s_ as_ if_ I_ do n_ ' _ t_ have_ a_ voice _ at_ all_ ._

So I need to work with individuals who can support me as an equal and become my voice.
So_ I_ need_ to_ work_ with_ ind i vi du al s_ who_ can_ suppo rt_ me_ as_ an_ equ al_ and_ become_ my_ voice _ ._

And that way, I'm able to maintain relevancy in society today.
And_ that_ way_ , \ 3 2 ;_ I_ ' _ m_ able_ to_ mai nt ain _ rel ev anc y_ in_ soci et y_ today_ ._

So at school, at work and institutions,  I work with many different ASL interpreters.
So_ at_ sc hoo l_ , \ 3 2 ;_ at_ work_ and_ inst it uti ons _ , \ 3 2 ; \ 3 2 ;_ I_ work_ with_ many_ different_ ASL_ inter pre ter s_ ._

And their voice becomes my voice and identity.
And_ their_ voice _ bec ome s_ my_ voice _ and_ ident ity_ ._

They help me to be heard.
They_ help_ me_ to_ be_ hear d_ ._

And their voices hold value and currency.
And_ their_ voice s_ hold _ va lu e_ and_ curren cy _ ._

Ironically, by borrowing out their voices,  I'm able to maintain a temporary form of currency,  kind of like taking out a loan with a very high interest rate.
I ron ical ly_ , \ 3 2 ;_ by_ bor ro wi ng_ out_ their_ voice s_ , \ 3 2 ; \ 3 2 ;_ I_ ' _ m_ able_ to_ mai nt ain _ a_ tem po rar y_ form_ of_ curren cy _ , \ 3 2 ; \ 3 2 ;_ kind_ of_ like_ tak ing_ out_ a_ lo an_ with_ a_ very_ high _ inter est_ rat e_ ._

If I didn't continue this practice,  I feel that I could just fade off into oblivion  and not maintain any form of social currency.
If_ I_ di d n_ ' _ t_ continu e_ this_ pr acti ce_ , \ 3 2 ; \ 3 2 ;_ I_ feel_ that_ I_ could_ just_ fa de_ off _ into_ ob livi on_ \ 3 2 ; \ 3 2 ;_ and_ not_ mai nt ain _ any_ form_ of_ social_ curren cy _ ._

So with sound as my new art medium,  I delved into the world of music.
So_ with_ sound_ as_ my_ new_ art _ medi um _ , \ 3 2 ; \ 3 2 ;_ I_ del ved_ into_ the_ world_ of_ music _ ._

And I was surprised to see the similarities between music and ASL.
And_ I_ was_ sur pr is ed_ to_ see_ the_ si mil ar iti es_ between_ music _ and_ ASL_ ._

For example,  a musical note  cannot be fully captured and expressed on paper.
For_ ex am ple _ , \ 3 2 ; \ 3 2 ;_ a_ music al_ not e_ \ 3 2 ; \ 3 2 ;_ can not_ be_ ful ly_ ca pt ure d_ and_ exp ress ed_ on_ paper _ ._

And the same holds true for a concept in ASL.
And_ the_ same_ hold s_ true _ for_ a_ con ce pt _ in_ ASL_ ._

They're both highly spatial and highly inflected --  meaning that subtle changes  can affect the entire meaning  of both signs and sounds.
They_ ' _ re_ bot h_ high ly_ spa ti al_ and_ high ly_ inf lec ted_ \ 3 2 ; - - \ 3 2 ; \ 3 2 ;_ mean ing_ that_ su b tle _ change s_ \ 3 2 ; \ 3 2 ;_ can_ aff ect _ the_ entire _ mean ing_ \ 3 2 ; \ 3 2 ;_ of_ bot h_ si g ns_ and_ sound s_ ._

I'd like to share with you a piano metaphor,  to have you have a better understanding of how ASL works.
I_ ' _ d_ like_ to_ sha re_ with_ you_ a_ pi an o_ met ap ho r_ , \ 3 2 ; \ 3 2 ;_ to_ have_ you_ have_ a_ better_ under stand ing_ of_ how_ ASL_ work s_ ._

So, envision a piano.
So_ , \ 3 2 ;_ en vis ion_ a_ pi an o_ ._

ASL is broken down into many different grammatical parameters.
ASL_ is_ bro ke n_ down _ into_ many_ different_ gra mm ati cal _ pa ra met ers_ ._

If you assign a different parameter to each finger as you play the piano --  such as facial expression, body movement,  speed, hand shape and so on,  as you play the piano --  English is a linear language,  as if one key is being pressed at a time.
If_ you_ as sign_ a_ different_ pa ra met er_ to_ each_ fin ger _ as_ you_ play _ the_ pi an o_ \ 3 2 ; - - \ 3 2 ; \ 3 2 ;_ such_ as_ fa ci al_ exp ress ion_ , \ 3 2 ;_ body_ mov eme nt_ , \ 3 2 ; \ 3 2 ;_ spe ed_ , \ 3 2 ;_ hand _ sha pe_ and_ so_ on_ , \ 3 2 ; \ 3 2 ;_ as_ you_ play _ the_ pi an o_ \ 3 2 ; - - \ 3 2 ; \ 3 2 ;_ E ngl ish _ is_ a_ line ar_ lang ua ge_ , \ 3 2 ; \ 3 2 ;_ as_ if_ one_ ke y_ is_ being_ pres sed _ at_ a_ time_ ._

However, ASL is more like a chord --  all 10 fingers need to come down simultaneously  to express a clear concept or idea in ASL.
How ever_ , \ 3 2 ;_ ASL_ is_ more_ like_ a_ cho rd _ \ 3 2 ; - - \ 3 2 ; \ 3 2 ;_ all_ 10_ fin ger s_ need_ to_ come_ down _ si mul ta ne ou sl y_ \ 3 2 ; \ 3 2 ;_ to_ exp ress _ a_ clear _ con ce pt _ or_ idea_ in_ ASL_ ._

If just one of those keys were to change the chord,  it would create a completely different meaning.
If_ just_ one_ of_ those_ ke ys_ were_ to_ change _ the_ cho rd _ , \ 3 2 ; \ 3 2 ;_ it_ would_ create_ a_ comp let el y_ different_ mean ing_ ._

The same applies to music in regards to pitch, tone and volume.
The_ same_ app lie s_ to_ music _ in_ re ga rd s_ to_ pi t ch_ , \ 3 2 ;_ to ne_ and_ vo lu me_ ._

In ASL, by playing around with these different grammatical parameters,  you can express different ideas.
In_ ASL_ , \ 3 2 ;_ by_ play ing_ around_ with_ these_ different_ gra mm ati cal _ pa ra met ers_ , \ 3 2 ; \ 3 2 ;_ you_ can_ exp ress _ different_ idea s_ ._

For example, take the sign TO-LOOK-AT.
For_ ex am ple _ , \ 3 2 ;_ take_ the_ sign_ T O _ - _ L O O K _ - _ A T _ ._

This is the sign TO-LOOK-AT.
This_ is_ the_ sign_ T O _ - _ L O O K _ - _ A T _ ._

I'm looking at you.
I_ ' _ m_ look ing_ at_ you_ ._

Staring at you.
S ta ring_ at_ you_ ._

Oh -- busted.
O h_ \ 3 2 ; - - \ 3 2 ;_ bu ste d_ ._

Uh-oh.
U h_ - _ o h_ ._

What are you looking at?
What_ are_ you_ look ing_ at_ ?_

Aw, stop.
A w_ , \ 3 2 ;_ sto p_ ._

I then started thinking,  "What if I was to look at ASL through a musical lens?"
I_ then_ started_ thinking_ , \ 3 2 ; \ 3 2 ; "_ What_ if_ I_ was_ to_ look_ at_ ASL_ through_ a_ music al_ len s_ ?"_

If I was to create a sign and repeat it over and over,  it could become like a piece of visual music.
If_ I_ was_ to_ create_ a_ sign_ and_ rep ea t_ it_ over_ and_ over_ , \ 3 2 ; \ 3 2 ;_ it_ could_ become_ like_ a_ piece _ of_ visual _ music _ ._

For example, this is the sign for "day,"  as the sun rises and sets.
For_ ex am ple _ , \ 3 2 ;_ this_ is_ the_ sign_ for_ \ 3 2 ; "_ day _ , " \ 3 2 ; \ 3 2 ;_ as_ the_ su n_ ris es_ and_ set s_ ._

This is "all day."
This_ is_ \ 3 2 ; "_ all_ day _ ."_

If I was to repeat it and slow it down,  visually it looks like a piece of music.
If_ I_ was_ to_ rep ea t_ it_ and_ sl ow_ it_ down _ , \ 3 2 ; \ 3 2 ;_ visual ly_ it_ look s_ like_ a_ piece _ of_ music _ ._

All ... day.
Al l_ \ 3 2 ; . . . \ 3 2 ;_ day _ ._

I feel the same holds true for "all night."
I_ feel_ the_ same_ hold s_ true _ for_ \ 3 2 ; "_ all_ night_ ."_

"All night."
"_ Al l_ night_ ."_

This is ALL-NIGHT, represented in this drawing.
This_ is_ A L L _ - _ N I G H T _ , \ 3 2 ;_ repr es ent ed_ in_ this_ draw ing_ ._

And this led me to thinking about three different kinds of nights:  "last night,"  "overnight,"   "all night long."
And_ this_ led _ me_ to_ thinking_ about_ three_ different_ ki nds _ of_ ni ght s_ : \ 3 2 ; \ 3 2 ; "_ last_ night_ , " \ 3 2 ; \ 3 2 ; "_ ov er night_ , " \ 3 2 ; \ 3 2 ; \ 3 2 ; "_ all_ night_ long _ ."_

I feel like the third one has a lot more musicality than the other two.
I_ feel_ like_ the_ th ird_ one_ has_ a_ lot_ more_ music ality _ than_ the_ other_ two_ ._

This represents how time is expressed in ASL  and how the distance from your body can express the changes in time.
This_ repr es ent s_ how_ time_ is_ exp ress ed_ in_ ASL_ \ 3 2 ; \ 3 2 ;_ and_ how_ the_ dist ance_ from_ your_ body_ can_ exp ress _ the_ change s_ in_ time_ ._

For example,  1H is one hand, 2H is two hand,  present tense happens closest and in front of the body,  future is in front of the body and the past is to your back.
For_ ex am ple _ , \ 3 2 ; \ 3 2 ;_ 1 H _ is_ one_ hand _ , \ 3 2 ;_ 2 H _ is_ two_ hand _ , \ 3 2 ; \ 3 2 ;_ pres ent_ ten se_ happen s_ close st_ and_ in_ front_ of_ the_ body_ , \ 3 2 ; \ 3 2 ;_ fu ture _ is_ in_ front_ of_ the_ body_ and_ the_ past_ is_ to_ your_ back_ ._

So, the first example is "a long time ago."
So_ , \ 3 2 ;_ the_ first_ ex am ple _ is_ \ 3 2 ; "_ a_ long _ time_ ago _ ."_

Then "past,"  "used to"  and the last one, which is my favorite,  with the very romantic and dramatic notion to it,  "once upon a time."
The n_ \ 3 2 ; "_ past_ , " \ 3 2 ; \ 3 2 ; "_ used_ to_ " \ 3 2 ; \ 3 2 ;_ and_ the_ last_ one_ , \ 3 2 ;_ which_ is_ my_ fa vo rit e_ , \ 3 2 ; \ 3 2 ;_ with_ the_ very_ romantic_ and_ d ra mat ic_ noti on_ to_ it_ , \ 3 2 ; \ 3 2 ; "_ on ce_ up on_ a_ time_ ."_

"Common time"  with a specific time signature of four beats per measure.
"_ Co mm on_ time_ " \ 3 2 ; \ 3 2 ;_ with_ a_ speci fi c_ time_ si g nature _ of_ four_ bea ts_ per _ meas ure_ ._

Yet when I see the word "common time,"  what automatically comes to mind for me is "at the same time."
Y et_ when_ I_ see_ the_ wor d_ \ 3 2 ; "_ comm on_ time_ , " \ 3 2 ; \ 3 2 ;_ what_ aut om ati cally _ com es_ to_ min d_ for_ me_ is_ \ 3 2 ; "_ at_ the_ same_ time_ ."_

So notice RH: right hand, LH: left hand.
So_ noti ce_ R H _ : \ 3 2 ;_ right_ hand _ , \ 3 2 ;_ L H _ : \ 3 2 ;_ le ft _ hand _ ._

We have the staff across the head and the chest.
We_ have_ the_ sta ff _ across_ the_ head _ and_ the_ ches t_ ._

[Head: RH, Flash claw]  [Common time]  [Chest: LH, Flash claw]  I'm now going to demonstrate a hand shape called the "flash claw."

Can you please follow along with me?
Ca n_ you_ ple ase _ fol low _ alon g_ with_ me_ ?_

Everybody, hands up.
E ver y body_ , \ 3 2 ;_ hand s_ up_ ._

Now we're going to do it in both the head and the chest,  kind of like "common time" or at the same time.
Now_ we_ ' _ re_ going_ to_ do_ it_ in_ bot h_ the_ head _ and_ the_ ches t_ , \ 3 2 ; \ 3 2 ;_ kind_ of_ like_ \ 3 2 ; "_ comm on_ time_ " \ 3 2 ;_ or_ at_ the_ same_ time_ ._

Yes, got it.
Y es_ , \ 3 2 ;_ got_ it_ ._

That means "to fall in love" in International [Sign].
Th at_ mean s_ \ 3 2 ; "_ to_ fall _ in_ love_ " \ 3 2 ;_ in_ In tern ation al_ \ 3 2 ; [ _ S ig n_ ] ._

International [Sign], as a note,  is a visual tool to help communicate  across cultures and sign languages around the world.
In tern ation al_ \ 3 2 ; [ _ S ig n_ ] , \ 3 2 ;_ as_ a_ not e_ , \ 3 2 ; \ 3 2 ;_ is_ a_ visual _ too l_ to_ help_ communi cat e_ \ 3 2 ; \ 3 2 ;_ across_ culture s_ and_ sign_ lang ua ge s_ around_ the_ world_ ._

The second one I'd like to demonstrate is this --  please follow along with me again.
The_ second _ one_ I_ ' _ d_ like_ to_ dem ons tra te_ is_ this_ \ 3 2 ; - - \ 3 2 ; \ 3 2 ;_ ple ase _ fol low _ alon g_ with_ me_ again _ ._

And now this.
And_ now_ this_ ._

This is "colonization" in ASL.
This_ is_ \ 3 2 ; "_ colo ni z ation_ " \ 3 2 ;_ in_ ASL_ ._

Now the third --  please follow along again.
Now_ the_ th ird_ \ 3 2 ; - - \ 3 2 ; \ 3 2 ;_ ple ase _ fol low _ alon g_ again _ ._

And again.
And_ again _ ._

This is "enlightenment" in ASL.
This_ is_ \ 3 2 ; "_ en light en ment_ " \ 3 2 ;_ in_ ASL_ ._

So let's do all three together.
So_ let _ ' _ s_ do_ all_ three_ together _ ._

"Fall in love,"  "colonization"  and "enlightenment."
"_ F all_ in_ love_ , " \ 3 2 ; \ 3 2 ; "_ colo ni z ation_ " \ 3 2 ; \ 3 2 ;_ and_ \ 3 2 ; "_ en light en ment_ ."_

Good job, everyone.
G o od_ j ob _ , \ 3 2 ;_ eve ry one_ ._

Notice how all three signs are very similar,  they all happen at the head and the chest,  but they convey quite different meanings.
No ti ce_ how_ all_ three_ si g ns_ are_ very_ si mil ar_ , \ 3 2 ; \ 3 2 ;_ they_ all_ happen _ at_ the_ head _ and_ the_ ches t_ , \ 3 2 ; \ 3 2 ;_ but_ they_ con ve y_ qui te_ different_ mean ing s_ ._

So it's amazing to see how ASL is alive and thriving,  just like music is.
So_ it_ ' _ s_ am azin g_ to_ see_ how_ ASL_ is_ ali ve_ and_ thr i vi ng_ , \ 3 2 ; \ 3 2 ;_ just_ like_ music _ is_ ._

However, in this day and age,  we live in a very audio-centric world.
How ever_ , \ 3 2 ;_ in_ this_ day _ and_ age_ , \ 3 2 ; \ 3 2 ;_ we_ live_ in_ a_ very_ a ud io _ - _ cent ri c_ world_ ._

And just because ASL has no sound to it,  it automatically holds no social currency.
And_ just_ because_ ASL_ has_ no_ sound_ to_ it_ , \ 3 2 ; \ 3 2 ;_ it_ aut om ati cally _ hold s_ no_ social_ curren cy _ ._

We need to start thinking harder about what defines social currency  and allow ASL to develop its own form of currency -- without sound.
We_ need_ to_ start _ thinking_ hard er_ about_ what_ def ine s_ social_ curren cy _ \ 3 2 ; \ 3 2 ;_ and_ allow _ ASL_ to_ de vel op _ its_ own_ form_ of_ curren cy _ \ 3 2 ; - - \ 3 2 ;_ without_ sound_ ._

And this could possibly be a step to lead to a more inclusive society.
And_ this_ could_ possib ly_ be_ a_ step_ to_ lea d_ to_ a_ more_ inclu si ve_ soci et y_ ._

And maybe people will understand  that you don't need to be deaf to learn ASL,  nor do you have to be hearing to learn music.
And_ may be_ people_ will_ understand_ \ 3 2 ; \ 3 2 ;_ that_ you_ do n_ ' _ t_ need_ to_ be_ dea f _ to_ learn _ ASL_ , \ 3 2 ; \ 3 2 ;_ nor _ do_ you_ have_ to_ be_ hear ing_ to_ learn _ music _ ._

ASL is such a rich treasure  that I'd like you to have the same experience.
ASL_ is_ such_ a_ ri ch_ tre as ure_ \ 3 2 ; \ 3 2 ;_ that_ I_ ' _ d_ like_ you_ to_ have_ the_ same_ experience _ ._

And I'd like to invite you to open your ears,  to open your eyes,  take part in our culture  and experience our visual language.
And_ I_ ' _ d_ like_ to_ inv ite _ you_ to_ ope n_ your_ ear s_ , \ 3 2 ; \ 3 2 ;_ to_ ope n_ your_ ey es_ , \ 3 2 ; \ 3 2 ;_ take_ part_ in_ our_ culture _ \ 3 2 ; \ 3 2 ;_ and_ experience _ our_ visual _ lang ua ge_ ._

And you never know,  you might just fall in love with us.
And_ you_ never_ know_ , \ 3 2 ; \ 3 2 ;_ you_ might_ just_ fall _ in_ love_ with_ us_ ._

Thank you.
Thank_ you_ ._

Denise Kahler-Braaten: Hey, that's me.
D en is e_ K ah ler _ - _ B ra ate n_ : \ 3 2 ;_ He y_ , \ 3 2 ;_ that_ ' _ s_ me_ ._

When I was a kid, my parents would tell me,  "You can make a mess, but you have to clean up after yourself."
When_ I_ was_ a_ ki d_ , \ 3 2 ;_ my_ parents_ would_ tell_ me_ , \ 3 2 ; \ 3 2 ; "_ You_ can_ make_ a_ mes s_ , \ 3 2 ;_ but_ you_ have_ to_ cle an_ up_ after_ you rs el f _ ."_

So freedom came with responsibility.
So_ free do m_ came_ with_ res po ns ib ili ty_ ._

But my imagination would take me to all these wonderful places,  where everything was possible.
But_ my_ imagin ation_ would_ take_ me_ to_ all_ these_ wo nd er ful_ place s_ , \ 3 2 ; \ 3 2 ;_ where_ everything_ was_ possib le_ ._

So I grew up in a bubble of innocence --  or a bubble of ignorance, I should say,  because adults would lie to us to protect us from the ugly truth.
So_ I_ gre w_ up_ in_ a_ bu b ble_ of_ inn oc ence_ \ 3 2 ; - - \ 3 2 ; \ 3 2 ;_ or_ a_ bu b ble_ of_ ig nor ance_ , \ 3 2 ;_ I_ should_ say_ , \ 3 2 ; \ 3 2 ;_ because_ adult s_ would_ lie _ to_ us_ to_ prot ect _ us_ from_ the_ u gl y_ tru th_ ._

And growing up, I found out that adults make a mess,  and they're not very good at cleaning up after themselves.
And_ grow ing_ up_ , \ 3 2 ;_ I_ found_ out_ that_ adult s_ make_ a_ mes s_ , \ 3 2 ; \ 3 2 ;_ and_ they_ ' _ re_ not_ very_ good_ at_ cle an ing_ up_ after_ the ms el ves_ ._

Fast forward, I am an adult now,  and I teach citizen science and invention at the Hong Kong Harbour School.
F ast _ for ward _ , \ 3 2 ;_ I_ am_ an_ adult _ now_ , \ 3 2 ; \ 3 2 ;_ and_ I_ tea ch_ ci ti ze n_ sci ence_ and_ invent ion_ at_ the_ Ho ng_ K ong _ Ha r bo ur _ S cho ol _ ._

And it doesn't take too long  before my students walk on a beach and stumble upon piles of trash.
And_ it_ does n_ ' _ t_ take_ too_ long _ \ 3 2 ; \ 3 2 ;_ before_ my_ students _ wal k_ on_ a_ bea ch_ and_ stu mbl e_ up on_ pi les_ of_ tra sh_ ._

So as good citizens, we clean up the beaches --  and no, he is not drinking alcohol, and if he is, I did not give it to him.
So_ as_ good_ ci ti ze ns_ , \ 3 2 ;_ we_ cle an_ up_ the_ bea ches _ \ 3 2 ; - - \ 3 2 ; \ 3 2 ;_ and_ no_ , \ 3 2 ;_ he_ is_ not_ dri nk ing_ al co ho l_ , \ 3 2 ;_ and_ if_ he_ is_ , \ 3 2 ;_ I_ did_ not_ give _ it_ to_ hi m_ ._

And so it's sad to say,  but today more than 80 percent of the oceans have plastic in them.
And_ so_ it_ ' _ s_ sa d_ to_ say_ , \ 3 2 ; \ 3 2 ;_ but_ today_ more_ than_ 8 0_ percent _ of_ the_ ocean s_ have_ plastic _ in_ them_ ._

It's a horrifying fact.
It_ ' _ s_ a_ ho rr ify ing_ fact _ ._

And in past decades,  we've been taking those big ships out and those big nets,  and we collect those plastic bits that we look at under a microscope,  and we sort them,  and then we put this data onto a map.
And_ in_ past_ dec ade s_ , \ 3 2 ; \ 3 2 ;_ we_ ' _ ve_ been_ tak ing_ those_ bi g_ shi p s_ out_ and_ those_ bi g_ ne ts_ , \ 3 2 ; \ 3 2 ;_ and_ we_ colle ct_ those_ plastic _ bit s_ that_ we_ look_ at_ under_ a_ micro sc ope _ , \ 3 2 ; \ 3 2 ;_ and_ we_ sor t_ them_ , \ 3 2 ; \ 3 2 ;_ and_ then_ we_ put_ this_ da ta _ on to_ a_ ma p_ ._

But that takes forever, it's very expensive,  and so it's quite risky to take those big boats out.
But_ that_ tak es_ fore ver _ , \ 3 2 ;_ it_ ' _ s_ very_ expe ns ive_ , \ 3 2 ; \ 3 2 ;_ and_ so_ it_ ' _ s_ qui te_ ris k y_ to_ take_ those_ bi g_ bo at s_ out_ ._

So with my students, ages six to 15,  we've been dreaming of inventing a better way.
So_ with_ my_ students _ , \ 3 2 ;_ age s_ si x _ to_ 1 5 _ , \ 3 2 ; \ 3 2 ;_ we_ ' _ ve_ been_ dre am ing_ of_ invent ing_ a_ better_ way_ ._

So we've transformed our tiny Hong Kong classroom into a workshop.
So_ we_ ' _ ve_ trans form ed_ our_ tin y_ Ho ng_ K ong _ cla ss ro om _ into_ a_ work sho p_ ._

And so we started building this small workbench,  with different heights, so even really short kids can participate.
And_ so_ we_ started_ build ing_ this_ small_ work be nc h_ , \ 3 2 ; \ 3 2 ;_ with_ different_ he ight s_ , \ 3 2 ;_ so_ even_ really_ sho rt_ kids_ can_ part ici pat e_ ._

And let me tell you, kids with power tools are awesome and safe.
And_ let _ me_ tell_ you_ , \ 3 2 ;_ kids_ with_ power_ too ls _ are_ aw es ome _ and_ sa fe _ ._

Not really.
No t_ really_ ._

And so, back to plastic.
And_ so_ , \ 3 2 ;_ back_ to_ plastic _ ._

We collect this plastic and we grind it to the size we find it in the ocean,  which is very small because it breaks down.
We_ colle ct_ this_ plastic _ and_ we_ gr ind _ it_ to_ the_ si ze _ we_ find_ it_ in_ the_ ocean _ , \ 3 2 ; \ 3 2 ;_ which_ is_ very_ small_ because_ it_ brea ks _ down _ ._

And so this is how we work.
And_ so_ this_ is_ how_ we_ work_ ._

I let the imaginations of my students run wild.
I_ let _ the_ imagin ation s_ of_ my_ students _ ru n_ wi ld _ ._

And my job is to try to collect the best of each kid's idea  and try to combine it into something that hopefully would work.
And_ my_ j ob _ is_ to_ try_ to_ colle ct_ the_ bes t_ of_ each_ ki d_ ' _ s_ idea_ \ 3 2 ; \ 3 2 ;_ and_ try_ to_ combin e_ it_ into_ something_ that_ hope ful ly_ would_ work_ ._

And so we have agreed that instead of collecting plastic bits,  we are going to collect only the data.
And_ so_ we_ have_ ag ree d_ that_ inst ead_ of_ colle cti ng_ plastic _ bit s_ , \ 3 2 ; \ 3 2 ;_ we_ are_ going_ to_ colle ct_ only_ the_ da ta _ ._

So we're going to get an image of the plastic with a robot --  so robots, kids get very excited.
So_ we_ ' _ re_ going_ to_ get_ an_ im age_ of_ the_ plastic _ with_ a_ robot _ \ 3 2 ; - - \ 3 2 ; \ 3 2 ;_ so_ robot s_ , \ 3 2 ;_ kids_ get_ very_ ex ci ted_ ._

And the next thing we do -- we do what we call "rapid prototyping."
And_ the_ next_ thing_ we_ do_ \ 3 2 ; - - \ 3 2 ;_ we_ do_ what_ we_ call_ \ 3 2 ; "_ rap i d_ prot ot y pi ng_ ."_

We are so rapid at prototyping  that the lunch is still in the lunchbox when we're hacking it.
We_ are_ so_ rap i d_ at_ prot ot y pi ng_ \ 3 2 ; \ 3 2 ;_ that_ the_ lu nc h_ is_ still_ in_ the_ lu nc h box_ when_ we_ ' _ re_ ha ck ing_ it_ ._

And we hack table lamps and webcams, into plumbing fixtures  and we assemble that into a floating robot that will be slowly moving through water  and this is the image that we get in the robot.
And_ we_ ha ck_ table _ la mp s_ and_ we b ca ms_ , \ 3 2 ;_ into_ pl um bi ng_ fi x ture s_ \ 3 2 ; \ 3 2 ;_ and_ we_ asse mbl e_ that_ into_ a_ fl o ati ng_ robot _ that_ will_ be_ sl ow ly_ mov ing_ through_ water _ \ 3 2 ; \ 3 2 ;_ and_ this_ is_ the_ im age_ that_ we_ get_ in_ the_ robot _ ._

So we see the plastic pieces floating slowly through the sensor,  and the computer on board will process this image,  and measure the size of each particle,  so we have a rough estimate of how much plastic there is in the water.
So_ we_ see_ the_ plastic _ piece s_ fl o ati ng_ sl ow ly_ through_ the_ sens or_ , \ 3 2 ; \ 3 2 ;_ and_ the_ comp ut er_ on_ bo ar d_ will_ process _ this_ im age_ , \ 3 2 ; \ 3 2 ;_ and_ meas ure_ the_ si ze _ of_ each_ part ic le_ , \ 3 2 ; \ 3 2 ;_ so_ we_ have_ a_ ro ugh _ esti mat e_ of_ how_ much_ plastic _ there_ is_ in_ the_ water _ ._

So we documented this invention step by step  on a website for inventors called Instructables,  in the hope that somebody would make it even better.
So_ we_ do cu ment ed_ this_ invent ion_ step_ by_ step_ \ 3 2 ; \ 3 2 ;_ on_ a_ we b site _ for_ invent ors _ called_ In str uc table s_ , \ 3 2 ; \ 3 2 ;_ in_ the_ hope _ that_ some body_ would_ make_ it_ even_ better_ ._

What was really cool about this project was that the students saw a local problem,  and boom -- they are trying to immediately address it.
What_ was_ really_ coo l_ about_ this_ project _ was_ that_ the_ students _ sa w_ a_ loca l_ problem _ , \ 3 2 ; \ 3 2 ;_ and_ bo om _ \ 3 2 ; - - \ 3 2 ;_ they_ are_ try ing_ to_ im medi ate ly_ add ress _ it_ ._

[I can investigate my local problem]  But my students in Hong Kong are hyperconnected kids.
[ _ I_ can_ inv esti ga te_ my_ loca l_ problem _ ] \ 3 2 ; \ 3 2 ;_ But_ my_ students _ in_ Ho ng_ K ong _ are_ h y per con ne cte d_ kids_ ._

And they watch the news, they watch the Internet,  and they came across this image.
And_ they_ wa t ch_ the_ ne w s_ , \ 3 2 ;_ they_ wa t ch_ the_ In tern et_ , \ 3 2 ; \ 3 2 ;_ and_ they_ came_ across_ this_ im age_ ._

This was a child, probably under 10, cleaning up an oil spill bare-handed,  in the Sundarbans, which is the world's largest mangrove forest in Bangladesh.
This_ was_ a_ child _ , \ 3 2 ;_ pro bab ly_ under_ 10_ , \ 3 2 ;_ cle an ing_ up_ an_ oi l_ spi ll_ ba re_ - _ hand ed_ , \ 3 2 ; \ 3 2 ;_ in_ the_ S und ar ba ns_ , \ 3 2 ;_ which_ is_ the_ world_ ' _ s_ large st_ man gr ov e_ fore st_ in_ Ba ngl ade sh_ ._

So they were very shocked,  because this is the water they drink, this is the water they bathe in,  this is the water they fish in -- this is the place where they live.
So_ they_ were_ very_ sho ck ed_ , \ 3 2 ; \ 3 2 ;_ because_ this_ is_ the_ water _ they_ dri nk _ , \ 3 2 ;_ this_ is_ the_ water _ they_ ba the_ in_ , \ 3 2 ; \ 3 2 ;_ this_ is_ the_ water _ they_ fi sh_ in_ \ 3 2 ; - - \ 3 2 ;_ this_ is_ the_ place_ where_ they_ live_ ._

And also you can see the water is brown, the mud is brown and oil is brown,  so when everything is mixed up,  it's really hard to see what's in the water.
And_ also_ you_ can_ see_ the_ water _ is_ bro w n_ , \ 3 2 ;_ the_ m ud _ is_ bro w n_ and_ oi l_ is_ bro w n_ , \ 3 2 ; \ 3 2 ;_ so_ when_ everything_ is_ mi x ed_ up_ , \ 3 2 ; \ 3 2 ;_ it_ ' _ s_ really_ hard _ to_ see_ what_ ' _ s_ in_ the_ water _ ._

But, there's a technology that's rather simple,  that's called spectrometry,  that allows you see what's in the water.
But_ , \ 3 2 ;_ there_ ' _ s_ a_ tec hn ol og y_ that_ ' _ s_ rat her_ simpl e_ , \ 3 2 ; \ 3 2 ;_ that_ ' _ s_ called_ spec t ro met ry_ , \ 3 2 ; \ 3 2 ;_ that_ allow s_ you_ see_ what_ ' _ s_ in_ the_ water _ ._

So we built a rough prototype of a spectrometer,  and you can shine light through different substances  that produce different spectrums,  so that can help you identify what's in the water.
So_ we_ built _ a_ ro ugh _ prot ot y pe_ of_ a_ spec t ro met er_ , \ 3 2 ; \ 3 2 ;_ and_ you_ can_ shi ne_ light _ through_ different_ su b sta nce s_ \ 3 2 ; \ 3 2 ;_ that_ produce _ different_ spec tru ms_ , \ 3 2 ; \ 3 2 ;_ so_ that_ can_ help_ you_ ident ify _ what_ ' _ s_ in_ the_ water _ ._

So we packed this prototype of a sensor,  and we shipped it to Bangladesh.
So_ we_ pa ck ed_ this_ prot ot y pe_ of_ a_ sens or_ , \ 3 2 ; \ 3 2 ;_ and_ we_ shi pp ed_ it_ to_ Ba ngl ade sh_ ._

So what was cool about this project  was that beyond addressing a local problem,  or looking at a local problem,  my students used their empathy and their sense of being creative  to help, remotely, other kids.
So_ what_ was_ coo l_ about_ this_ project _ \ 3 2 ; \ 3 2 ;_ was_ that_ be yon d_ add ress ing_ a_ loca l_ problem _ , \ 3 2 ; \ 3 2 ;_ or_ look ing_ at_ a_ loca l_ problem _ , \ 3 2 ; \ 3 2 ;_ my_ students _ used_ their_ em pat h y_ and_ their_ sens e_ of_ being_ creati ve_ \ 3 2 ; \ 3 2 ;_ to_ help_ , \ 3 2 ;_ rem ot el y_ , \ 3 2 ;_ other_ kids_ ._

[I can investigate a remote problem]  So I was very compelled by doing the second experiments,  and I wanted to take it even further --  maybe addressing an even harder problem, and it's also closer to my heart.
[ _ I_ can_ inv esti ga te_ a_ rem ot e_ problem _ ] \ 3 2 ; \ 3 2 ;_ So_ I_ was_ very_ comp ell ed_ by_ do ing_ the_ second _ expe ri ment s_ , \ 3 2 ; \ 3 2 ;_ and_ I_ want ed_ to_ take_ it_ even_ fu rt her_ \ 3 2 ; - - \ 3 2 ; \ 3 2 ;_ may be_ add ress ing_ an_ even_ hard er_ problem _ , \ 3 2 ;_ and_ it_ ' _ s_ also_ close r_ to_ my_ hear t_ ._

So I'm half Japanese and half French,  and maybe you remember in 2011 there was a massive earthquake in Japan.
So_ I_ ' _ m_ ha lf _ J ap an es e_ and_ ha lf _ F re nc h_ , \ 3 2 ; \ 3 2 ;_ and_ may be_ you_ rem emb er_ in_ 20 1 1 _ there_ was_ a_ mas si ve_ ear th q ua ke_ in_ J ap an_ ._

It was so violent that it triggered several giant waves --  they are called tsunami --  and those tsunami destroyed many cities on the eastern coast of Japan.
It_ was_ so_ violen t_ that_ it_ tri gg ere d_ se ver al_ gi ant _ wa ves_ \ 3 2 ; - - \ 3 2 ; \ 3 2 ;_ they_ are_ called_ t su na mi _ \ 3 2 ; - - \ 3 2 ; \ 3 2 ;_ and_ those_ t su na mi _ des t ro ye d_ many_ ci tie s_ on_ the_ eas tern _ co ast _ of_ J ap an_ ._

More than 14,000 people died in an instant.
M or e_ than_ 1 4 _ ,_ 00 0_ people_ die d_ in_ an_ inst ant _ ._

Also, it damaged the nuclear power plant of Fukushima,  the nuclear power plant just by the water.
Al so_ , \ 3 2 ;_ it_ da mag ed_ the_ nu clear _ power_ plan t_ of_ F u k us hi ma _ , \ 3 2 ; \ 3 2 ;_ the_ nu clear _ power_ plan t_ just_ by_ the_ water _ ._

And today, I read the reports  and an average of 300 tons  are leaking from the nuclear power plant into the Pacific Ocean.
And_ today_ , \ 3 2 ;_ I_ read _ the_ rep ort s_ \ 3 2 ; \ 3 2 ;_ and_ an_ a ver age_ of_ 30 0_ to ns_ \ 3 2 ; \ 3 2 ;_ are_ lea king_ from_ the_ nu clear _ power_ plan t_ into_ the_ P ac i fi c_ O ce an_ ._

And today the whole Pacific Ocean has traces of contamination of cesium-137.
And_ today_ the_ who le_ P ac i fi c_ O ce an_ has_ tra ces _ of_ conta min ation_ of_ ces i um _ - _ 1 3 7 _ ._

If you go outside on the West Coast, you can measure Fukushima everywhere.
If_ you_ go_ out side_ on_ the_ We st_ Co ast _ , \ 3 2 ;_ you_ can_ meas ure_ F u k us hi ma _ eve ry where_ ._

But if you look at the map, it can look like most of the radioactivity  has been washed away from the Japanese coast,  and most of it is now -- it looks like it's safe, it's blue.
But_ if_ you_ look_ at_ the_ ma p_ , \ 3 2 ;_ it_ can_ look_ like_ most_ of_ the_ radio acti vit y_ \ 3 2 ; \ 3 2 ;_ has_ been_ wa she d_ away_ from_ the_ J ap an es e_ co ast _ , \ 3 2 ; \ 3 2 ;_ and_ most_ of_ it_ is_ now_ \ 3 2 ; - - \ 3 2 ;_ it_ look s_ like_ it_ ' _ s_ sa fe _ , \ 3 2 ;_ it_ ' _ s_ bl ue _ ._

Well, reality is a bit more complicated than this.
We ll_ , \ 3 2 ;_ real ity_ is_ a_ bit_ more_ comp lic ated _ than_ this_ ._

So I've been going to Fukushima every year since the accident,  and I measure independently and with other scientists,  on land, in the river --  and this time we wanted to take the kids.
So_ I_ ' _ ve_ been_ going_ to_ F u k us hi ma _ every_ year_ si nce _ the_ ac ci den t_ , \ 3 2 ; \ 3 2 ;_ and_ I_ meas ure_ ind ep end ent ly_ and_ with_ other_ scientist s_ , \ 3 2 ; \ 3 2 ;_ on_ lan d_ , \ 3 2 ;_ in_ the_ ri ver _ \ 3 2 ; - - \ 3 2 ; \ 3 2 ;_ and_ this_ time_ we_ want ed_ to_ take_ the_ kids_ ._

So of course we didn't take the kids, the parents wouldn't allow that to happen.
So_ of_ cour se_ we_ di d n_ ' _ t_ take_ the_ kids_ , \ 3 2 ;_ the_ parents_ wo ul d n_ ' _ t_ allow _ that_ to_ happen _ ._

But every night we would report to "Mission Control" --  different masks they're wearing.
But_ every_ night_ we_ would_ rep ort _ to_ \ 3 2 ; "_ M is sion _ Co nt ro l_ " \ 3 2 ; - - \ 3 2 ; \ 3 2 ;_ different_ mas ks _ they_ ' _ re_ we ar ing_ ._

It could look like they didn't take the work seriously, but they really did  because they're going to have to live with radioactivity their whole life.
It_ could_ look_ like_ they_ di d n_ ' _ t_ take_ the_ work_ ser io us ly_ , \ 3 2 ;_ but_ they_ really_ did_ \ 3 2 ; \ 3 2 ;_ because_ they_ ' _ re_ going_ to_ have_ to_ live_ with_ radio acti vit y_ their_ who le_ life_ ._

And so what we did with them  is that we'd discuss the data we collected that day,  and talk about where we should be going next --  strategy, itinerary, etc...
And_ so_ what_ we_ did_ with_ them_ \ 3 2 ; \ 3 2 ;_ is_ that_ we_ ' _ d_ dis cus s_ the_ da ta _ we_ colle cte d_ that_ day _ , \ 3 2 ; \ 3 2 ;_ and_ talk_ about_ where_ we_ should_ be_ going_ next_ \ 3 2 ; - - \ 3 2 ; \ 3 2 ;_ stra te g y_ , \ 3 2 ;_ iti ner ar y_ , \ 3 2 ;_ et c_ . . ._

And to do this, we built a very rough topographical map  of the region around the nuclear power plant.
And_ to_ do_ this_ , \ 3 2 ;_ we_ built _ a_ very_ ro ugh _ to po gra phi cal _ ma p_ \ 3 2 ; \ 3 2 ;_ of_ the_ re gi on_ around_ the_ nu clear _ power_ plan t_ ._

And so we built the elevation map,  we sprinkled pigments to represent real-time data for radioactivity,  and we sprayed water to simulate the rainfall.

And with this we could see that the radioactive dust  was washing from the top of the mountain into the river system,  and leaking into the ocean.

So it was a rough estimate.

But with this in mind, we organized this expedition,  which was the closest civilians have been to the nuclear power plant.

We are sailing 1.5 kilometers away from the nuclear power plant,  and with the help of the local fisherman,  we are collecting sediment from the seabed  with a custom sediment sampler we've invented and built.

We pack the sediment into small bags,  we then dispatch them to hundreds of small bags  that we send to different universities,  and we produce the map of the seabed radioactivity,  especially in estuaries where the fish will reproduce,  and I will hope that we will have improved  the safety of the local fishermen and of your favorite sushi.

You can see a progression here --  we've gone from a local problem to a remote problem to a global problem.

At least since the Industrial Revolution, the world of design has been dominated  by the rigors of manufacturing and mass production.

Assembly lines have dictated a world made of parts,  framing the imagination of designers and architects  who have been trained to think about their objects as assemblies  of discrete parts with distinct functions.

These fields are computational design,  allowing us to design complex forms with simple code;  additive manufacturing, letting us produce parts  by adding material rather than carving it out;  materials engineering, which lets us design the behavior of materials  in high resolution;  and synthetic biology,  enabling us to design new biological functionality by editing DNA.

This entire collection, Wanderers, that was named after planets,  was not to me really about fashion per se,  but it provided an opportunity to speculate about the future  of our race on our planet and beyond,  to combine scientific insight with lots of mystery  and to move away from the age of the machine  to a new age of symbiosis between our bodies,  the microorganisms that we inhabit,  our products and even our buildings.

The silkworm first attaches itself to the environment --  it creates a tensile structure --  and it then starts spinning a compressive cocoon.

We placed it inside a box with magnetic sensors,  and that allowed us to create this 3-dimensional point cloud  and visualize the complex architecture of the silkworm cocoon.

However, when we placed the silkworm on a flat patch,  not inside a box,  we realized it would spin a flat cocoon  and it would still healthily metamorphisize.

So we started designing different environments, different scaffolds,  and we discovered that the shape, the composition,  the structure of the cocoon, was directly informed by the environment.

This continued after high school,  and at a certain point, I began to notice this pattern in myself  where I would become interested in an area  and I would dive in, become all-consumed,  and I'd get to be pretty good at whatever it was,  and then I would hit this point where I'd start to get bored.

And usually I would try and persist anyway,  because I had already devoted so much time and energy  and sometimes money into this field.

But eventually this sense of boredom,  this feeling of, like, yeah, I got this, this isn't challenging anymore --  it would get to be too much.

But then I would become interested in something else,  something totally unrelated, and I would dive into that,  and become all-consumed, and I'd be like, "Yes! I found my thing,"  and then I would hit this point again where I'd start to get bored.

This pattern caused me a lot of anxiety,  for two reasons.
This_ pat tern _ cause d_ me_ a_ lot_ of_ an x ie ty_ , \ 3 2 ; \ 3 2 ;_ for_ two_ reason s_ ._

The first was that I wasn't sure  how I was going to turn any of this into a career.

I thought that I would eventually have to pick one thing,  deny all of my other passions,  and just resign myself to being bored.

The other reason it caused me so much anxiety  was a little bit more personal.

If you can relate to my story and to these feelings,  I'd like you to ask yourself a question  that I wish I had asked myself back then.

In fact, it does just the opposite,  because when someone asks you what you want to be,  you can't reply with 20 different things,  though well-meaning adults will likely chuckle and be like,  "Oh, how cute, but you can't be a violin maker and a psychologist.

It's this idea of destiny or the one true calling,  the idea that we each have one great thing  we are meant to do during our time on this earth,  and you need to figure out what that thing is  and devote your life to it.

Here are three  multipotentialite super powers.
He re_ are_ three_ \ 3 2 ; \ 3 2 ;_ multipotentialite _ su per _ power s_ ._

One: idea synthesis.
One_ : \ 3 2 ;_ idea_ synthe si s_ ._

That is, combining two or more fields  and creating something new at the intersection.
Th at_ is_ , \ 3 2 ;_ combin ing_ two_ or_ more_ field s_ \ 3 2 ; \ 3 2 ;_ and_ creati ng_ something_ new_ at_ the_ inter sec tion_ ._

Meshu is a company that creates custom geographically-inspired jewelry.
M es hu _ is_ a_ compa n y_ that_ create s_ cus to m_ ge og rap hi cally _ - _ ins pir ed_ j ew el ry_ ._

Sha and Rachel came up with this unique idea  not despite, but because of their eclectic mix of skills and experiences.

Innovation happens at the intersections.
In no va tion_ happen s_ at_ the_ inter sec tion s_ ._

That's where the new ideas come from.
Th at_ ' _ s_ where_ the_ new_ idea s_ come_ from_ ._

And multipotentialites, with all of their backgrounds,  are able to access a lot of these points of intersection.
And_ multipotentialite s_ , \ 3 2 ;_ with_ all_ of_ their_ back gr ou nds _ , \ 3 2 ; \ 3 2 ;_ are_ able_ to_ acce ss_ a_ lot_ of_ these_ point s_ of_ inter sec tion_ ._

The second multipotentialite superpower is rapid learning.
The_ second _ multipotentialite _ su per power_ is_ rap i d_ learn ing_ ._

When multipotentialites become interested in something,  we go hard.
When_ multipotentialite s_ become_ inter est ed_ in_ something_ , \ 3 2 ; \ 3 2 ;_ we_ go_ hard _ ._

We observe everything we can get our hands on.
We_ ob ser ve_ everything_ we_ can_ get_ our_ hand s_ on_ ._

We're also used to being beginners,  because we've been beginners so many times in the past,  and this means that we're less afraid of trying new things  and stepping out of our comfort zones.
We_ ' _ re_ also_ used_ to_ being_ beg inn ers_ , \ 3 2 ; \ 3 2 ;_ because_ we_ ' _ ve_ been_ beg inn ers_ so_ many_ time s_ in_ the_ past_ , \ 3 2 ; \ 3 2 ;_ and_ this_ mean s_ that_ we_ ' _ re_ less _ af rai d_ of_ try ing_ new_ things_ \ 3 2 ; \ 3 2 ;_ and_ ste pp ing_ out_ of_ our_ com for t_ z one s_ ._

What's more, many skills are transferable across disciplines,  and we bring everything we've learned to every new area we pursue,  so we're rarely starting from scratch.
What_ ' _ s_ more_ , \ 3 2 ;_ many_ ski lls_ are_ trans fe ra ble_ across_ dis ci pl ine s_ , \ 3 2 ; \ 3 2 ;_ and_ we_ bri ng_ everything_ we_ ' _ ve_ learned_ to_ every_ new_ are a_ we_ pu rs ue _ , \ 3 2 ; \ 3 2 ;_ so_ we_ ' _ re_ rar el y_ start ing_ from_ sc rat ch_ ._

Before becoming a writer, Nora was a financial planner.
Be fore _ bec om ing_ a_ write r_ , \ 3 2 ;_ No ra _ was_ a_ fin anc ial _ plan ner _ ._

She had to learn the finer mechanics of sales when she was starting her practice,  and this skill now helps her write compelling pitches to editors.

It is rarely a waste of time to pursue something you're drawn to,  even if you end up quitting.

Fast Company magazine identified adaptability  as the single most important skill to develop in order to thrive  in the 21st century.

So with that said,  if there is one thing you take away from this talk,  I hope that it is this:  embrace your inner wiring, whatever that may be.

In the year 1901,  a woman called Auguste was taken to a medical asylum in Frankfurt.
In_ the_ year_ 19 0 1 _ , \ 3 2 ; \ 3 2 ;_ a_ woman _ called_ August e_ was_ tak en_ to_ a_ medical_ as y lu m_ in_ F ra nk fu rt_ ._

Auguste was delusional  and couldn't remember even the most basic details of her life.
August e_ was_ del us ion al_ \ 3 2 ; \ 3 2 ;_ and_ cou ld n_ ' _ t_ rem emb er_ even_ the_ most_ ba si c_ de tai ls _ of_ her_ life_ ._

Her doctor was called Alois.
He r_ doct or_ was_ called_ Al oi s_ ._

Alois didn't know how to help Auguste,  but he watched over her until, sadly, she passed away in 1906.
Al oi s_ di d n_ ' _ t_ know_ how_ to_ help_ August e_ , \ 3 2 ; \ 3 2 ;_ but_ he_ wa t che d_ over_ her_ until _ , \ 3 2 ;_ sa dl y_ , \ 3 2 ;_ she_ pass ed_ away_ in_ 19 0 6_ ._

After she died, Alois performed an autopsy  and found strange plaques and tangles in Auguste's brain --  the likes of which he'd never seen before.
A ft er_ she_ die d_ , \ 3 2 ;_ Al oi s_ per form ed_ an_ aut op sy _ \ 3 2 ; \ 3 2 ;_ and_ found_ stra nge _ pl a que s_ and_ ta ngl es_ in_ August e_ ' _ s_ brain_ \ 3 2 ; - - \ 3 2 ; \ 3 2 ;_ the_ like s_ of_ which_ he_ ' _ d_ never_ see n_ before_ ._

Now here's the even more striking thing.
Now_ here_ ' _ s_ the_ even_ more_ str i king_ thing_ ._

If Auguste had instead been alive today,  we could offer her no more help than Alois was able to 114 years ago.
If_ August e_ had_ inst ead_ been_ ali ve_ today_ , \ 3 2 ; \ 3 2 ;_ we_ could_ off er_ her_ no_ more_ help_ than_ Al oi s_ was_ able_ to_ 1 1 4 _ years_ ago _ ._

Alois was Dr. Alois Alzheimer.
Al oi s_ was_ D r_ . \ 3 2 ;_ Al oi s_ Al z he ime r_ ._

And Auguste Deter  was the first patient to be diagnosed with what we now call Alzheimer's disease.
And_ August e_ D et er_ \ 3 2 ; \ 3 2 ;_ was_ the_ first_ pat ie nt_ to_ be_ diagnos ed_ with_ what_ we_ now_ call_ Al z he ime r_ ' _ s_ disease _ ._

Since 1901, medicine has advanced greatly.
S inc e_ 19 0 1 _ , \ 3 2 ;_ medi cin e_ has_ ad va nce d_ gre at ly_ ._

We've discovered antibiotics and vaccines to protect us from infections,  many treatments for cancer, antiretrovirals for HIV,  statins for heart disease and much more.
We_ ' _ ve_ discover ed_ ant ib io ti c s_ and_ vac cin es_ to_ prot ect _ us_ from_ inf ecti ons _ , \ 3 2 ; \ 3 2 ;_ many_ treat ment s_ for_ can cer _ , \ 3 2 ;_ ant ir et ro vi ra ls _ for_ HIV_ , \ 3 2 ; \ 3 2 ;_ stati ns_ for_ hear t_ disease _ and_ much_ more_ ._

But we've made essentially no progress at all in treating Alzheimer's disease.
But_ we_ ' _ ve_ made_ ess enti ally_ no_ pro gre ss_ at_ all_ in_ treat ing_ Al z he ime r_ ' _ s_ disease _ ._

I'm part of a team of scientists  who has been working to find a cure for Alzheimer's for over a decade.
I_ ' _ m_ part_ of_ a_ tea m_ of_ scientist s_ \ 3 2 ; \ 3 2 ;_ who_ has_ been_ work ing_ to_ find_ a_ cur e_ for_ Al z he ime r_ ' _ s_ for_ over_ a_ dec ade _ ._

So I think about this all the time.
So_ I_ think_ about_ this_ all_ the_ time_ ._

Alzheimer's now affects 40 million people worldwide.
Al z he ime r_ ' _ s_ now_ aff ect s_ 4 0_ mil lion _ people_ world wi de_ ._

But by 2050, it will affect 150 million people --  which, by the way, will include many of you.
But_ by_ 20 50 _ , \ 3 2 ;_ it_ will_ aff ect _ 1 50 _ mil lion _ people_ \ 3 2 ; - - \ 3 2 ; \ 3 2 ;_ which_ , \ 3 2 ;_ by_ the_ way_ , \ 3 2 ;_ will_ inclu de_ many_ of_ you_ ._

If you're hoping to live to be 85 or older,  your chance of getting Alzheimer's will be almost one in two.
If_ you_ ' _ re_ ho pi ng_ to_ live_ to_ be_ 8 5 _ or_ old er_ , \ 3 2 ; \ 3 2 ;_ your_ chan ce_ of_ get ting_ Al z he ime r_ ' _ s_ will_ be_ al most_ one_ in_ two_ ._

In other words, odds are you'll spend your golden years  either suffering from Alzheimer's  or helping to look after a friend or loved one with Alzheimer's.
In_ other_ wor ds_ , \ 3 2 ;_ od ds_ are_ you_ ' _ ll_ spe nd_ your_ go ld en_ years_ \ 3 2 ; \ 3 2 ;_ ei ther_ su ff ering _ from_ Al z he ime r_ ' _ s_ \ 3 2 ; \ 3 2 ;_ or_ help ing_ to_ look_ after_ a_ friend _ or_ love d_ one_ with_ Al z he ime r_ ' _ s_ ._

Already in the United States alone,  Alzheimer's care costs 200 billion dollars every year.
Al read y_ in_ the_ U ni ted_ S tate s_ alon e_ , \ 3 2 ; \ 3 2 ;_ Al z he ime r_ ' _ s_ care _ co sts _ 20 0_ bil lion _ do lla rs_ every_ year_ ._

One out of every five Medicare dollars get spent on Alzheimer's.
One_ out_ of_ every_ fi ve_ M edi care _ do lla rs_ get_ spe nt_ on_ Al z he ime r_ ' _ s_ ._

It is today the most expensive disease,  and costs are projected to increase fivefold by 2050,  as the baby boomer generation ages.
It_ is_ today_ the_ most_ expe ns ive_ disease _ , \ 3 2 ; \ 3 2 ;_ and_ co sts _ are_ project ed_ to_ incre ase _ fi ve fol d_ by_ 20 50 _ , \ 3 2 ; \ 3 2 ;_ as_ the_ bab y_ bo ome r_ gener ation_ age s_ ._

It may surprise you that, put simply,  Alzheimer's is one of the biggest medical and social challenges of our generation.
It_ may _ sur pr is e_ you_ that_ , \ 3 2 ;_ put_ simpl y_ , \ 3 2 ; \ 3 2 ;_ Al z he ime r_ ' _ s_ is_ one_ of_ the_ bi gg est_ medical_ and_ social_ ch all eng es_ of_ our_ gener ation_ ._

But we've done relatively little to address it.
But_ we_ ' _ ve_ do ne_ rel ati vel y_ little_ to_ add ress _ it_ ._

Today, of the top 10 causes of death worldwide,  Alzheimer's is the only one we cannot prevent, cure or even slow down.
To day _ , \ 3 2 ;_ of_ the_ to p_ 10_ cause s_ of_ dea th_ world wi de_ , \ 3 2 ; \ 3 2 ;_ Al z he ime r_ ' _ s_ is_ the_ only_ one_ we_ can not_ prev ent_ , \ 3 2 ;_ cur e_ or_ even_ sl ow_ down _ ._

We understand less about the science of Alzheimer's than other diseases  because we've invested less time and money into researching it.
We_ understand_ less _ about_ the_ sci ence_ of_ Al z he ime r_ ' _ s_ than_ other_ disease s_ \ 3 2 ; \ 3 2 ;_ because_ we_ ' _ ve_ inv est ed_ less _ time_ and_ mon ey _ into_ research ing_ it_ ._

The US government spends 10 times more every year  on cancer research than on Alzheimer's  despite the fact that Alzheimer's costs us more  and causes a similar number of deaths each year as cancer.
The_ U S _ govern ment_ spe nds _ 10_ time s_ more_ every_ year_ \ 3 2 ; \ 3 2 ;_ on_ can cer _ research _ than_ on_ Al z he ime r_ ' _ s_ \ 3 2 ; \ 3 2 ;_ des pi te_ the_ fact _ that_ Al z he ime r_ ' _ s_ co sts _ us_ more_ \ 3 2 ; \ 3 2 ;_ and_ cause s_ a_ si mil ar_ number_ of_ dea ths _ each_ year_ as_ can cer _ ._

The lack of resources stems from a more fundamental cause:  a lack of awareness.
The_ la ck_ of_ res ou rc es_ ste ms_ from_ a_ more_ fu nd ame nt al_ cause _ : \ 3 2 ; \ 3 2 ;_ a_ la ck_ of_ aw are nes s_ ._

Because here's what few people know but everyone should:  Alzheimer's is a disease, and we can cure it.
Be cause _ here_ ' _ s_ what_ few_ people_ know_ but_ eve ry one_ should_ : \ 3 2 ; \ 3 2 ;_ Al z he ime r_ ' _ s_ is_ a_ disease _ , \ 3 2 ;_ and_ we_ can_ cur e_ it_ ._

For most of the past 114 years,  everyone, including scientists, mistakenly confused Alzheimer's with aging.
For_ most_ of_ the_ past_ 1 1 4 _ years_ , \ 3 2 ; \ 3 2 ;_ eve ry one_ , \ 3 2 ;_ inclu ding_ scientist s_ , \ 3 2 ;_ mi sta ke n ly_ conf used_ Al z he ime r_ ' _ s_ with_ ag ing_ ._

We thought that becoming senile  was a normal and inevitable part of getting old.
We_ thought_ that_ bec om ing_ se ni le_ \ 3 2 ; \ 3 2 ;_ was_ a_ nor ma l_ and_ ine vit able_ part_ of_ get ting_ old _ ._

But we only have to look at a picture  of a healthy aged brain compared to the brain of an Alzheimer's patient  to see the real physical damage caused by this disease.
But_ we_ only_ have_ to_ look_ at_ a_ pi ct ure_ \ 3 2 ; \ 3 2 ;_ of_ a_ hea lt h y_ age d_ brain_ compa red_ to_ the_ brain_ of_ an_ Al z he ime r_ ' _ s_ pat ie nt_ \ 3 2 ; \ 3 2 ;_ to_ see_ the_ real _ ph ys ical_ da mag e_ cause d_ by_ this_ disease _ ._

As well as triggering severe loss of memory and mental abilities,  the damage to the brain caused by Alzheimer's  significantly reduces life expectancy and is always fatal.
As_ well _ as_ tri gg ering _ se ver e_ los s_ of_ me mor y_ and_ ment al_ abilit ies_ , \ 3 2 ; \ 3 2 ;_ the_ da mag e_ to_ the_ brain_ cause d_ by_ Al z he ime r_ ' _ s_ \ 3 2 ; \ 3 2 ;_ si g ni fi can t ly_ re duc es_ life_ expe ct anc y_ and_ is_ always_ fa tal _ ._

Remember Dr. Alzheimer found strange plaques and tangles  in Auguste's brain a century ago.
R eme mber _ D r_ . \ 3 2 ;_ Al z he ime r_ found_ stra nge _ pl a que s_ and_ ta ngl es_ \ 3 2 ; \ 3 2 ;_ in_ August e_ ' _ s_ brain_ a_ cent ur y_ ago _ ._

For almost a century, we didn't know much about these.
For_ al most_ a_ cent ur y_ , \ 3 2 ;_ we_ di d n_ ' _ t_ know_ much_ about_ these_ ._

Today we know they're made from protein molecules.
To day _ we_ know_ they_ ' _ re_ made_ from_ prot ei n_ mo lec ul es_ ._

You can imagine a protein molecule  as a piece of paper that normally folds into an elaborate piece of origami.
You_ can_ imagin e_ a_ prot ei n_ mo lec ul e_ \ 3 2 ; \ 3 2 ;_ as_ a_ piece _ of_ paper _ that_ nor ma lly_ fol ds_ into_ an_ el ab orat e_ piece _ of_ ori ga mi _ ._

There are spots on the paper that are sticky.
There_ are_ spo ts_ on_ the_ paper _ that_ are_ stic k y_ ._

And when it folds correctly, these sticky bits end up on the inside.
And_ when_ it_ fol ds_ cor rect ly_ , \ 3 2 ;_ these_ stic k y_ bit s_ end _ up_ on_ the_ inside_ ._

But sometimes things go wrong, and some sticky bits are on the outside.
But_ somet imes_ things_ go_ wrong_ , \ 3 2 ;_ and_ some_ stic k y_ bit s_ are_ on_ the_ out side_ ._

This causes the protein molecules to stick to each other,  forming clumps that eventually become large plaques and tangles.
This_ cause s_ the_ prot ei n_ mo lec ul es_ to_ stic k_ to_ each_ other_ , \ 3 2 ; \ 3 2 ;_ form ing_ cl um p s_ that_ eve nt ually_ become_ large _ pl a que s_ and_ ta ngl es_ ._

That's what we see in the brains of Alzheimer's patients.
Th at_ ' _ s_ what_ we_ see_ in_ the_ bra ins _ of_ Al z he ime r_ ' _ s_ patients _ ._

We've spent the past 10 years at the University of Cambridge  trying to understand how this malfunction works.
We_ ' _ ve_ spe nt_ the_ past_ 10_ years_ at_ the_ U ni vers ity_ of_ Ca m bri d ge_ \ 3 2 ; \ 3 2 ;_ try ing_ to_ understand_ how_ this_ ma lf un cti on_ work s_ ._

There are many steps, and identifying which step to try to block is complex --  like defusing a bomb.
There_ are_ many_ ste p s_ , \ 3 2 ;_ and_ ident ify ing_ which_ step_ to_ try_ to_ blo ck_ is_ complex_ \ 3 2 ; - - \ 3 2 ; \ 3 2 ;_ like_ def using_ a_ bo m b _ ._

Cutting one wire might do nothing.
C ut ting_ one_ wi re_ might_ do_ nothing _ ._

Cutting others might make the bomb explore.
C ut ting_ other s_ might_ make_ the_ bo m b _ expl or e_ ._

We have to find the right step to block,  and then create a drug that does it.
We_ have_ to_ find_ the_ right_ step_ to_ blo ck_ , \ 3 2 ; \ 3 2 ;_ and_ then_ create_ a_ drug _ that_ does _ it_ ._

Until recently, we for the most part  have been cutting wires and hoping for the best.
U nt il _ rec ent ly_ , \ 3 2 ;_ we_ for_ the_ most_ part_ \ 3 2 ; \ 3 2 ;_ have_ been_ cu tt ing_ wi res _ and_ ho pi ng_ for_ the_ bes t_ ._

But now we've got together a diverse group of people --  medics, biologists, geneticists, chemists, physicists, engineers and mathematicians.
But_ now_ we_ ' _ ve_ got_ together _ a_ div ers e_ group _ of_ people_ \ 3 2 ; - - \ 3 2 ; \ 3 2 ;_ medi c s_ , \ 3 2 ;_ biolog ist s_ , \ 3 2 ;_ gen eti ci sts _ , \ 3 2 ;_ che mi sts _ , \ 3 2 ;_ ph ys ici sts _ , \ 3 2 ;_ eng ine ers_ and_ mat he mat ici an s_ ._

And together, we've managed to identify a critical step in the process  and are now testing a new class of drugs which would specifically block this step  and stop the disease.
And_ together _ , \ 3 2 ;_ we_ ' _ ve_ man age d_ to_ ident ify _ a_ crit ical_ step_ in_ the_ process _ \ 3 2 ; \ 3 2 ;_ and_ are_ now_ test ing_ a_ new_ cla ss_ of_ drugs_ which_ would_ speci fi cally _ blo ck_ this_ step_ \ 3 2 ; \ 3 2 ;_ and_ sto p_ the_ disease _ ._

Now let me show you some of our latest results.
Now_ let _ me_ sho w_ you_ some_ of_ our_ late st_ res ult s_ ._

No one outside of our lab has seen these yet.
No _ one_ out side_ of_ our_ lab _ has_ see n_ these_ ye t_ ._

Let's look at some videos of what happened when we tested these new drugs in worms.
L et_ ' _ s_ look_ at_ some_ vi de os _ of_ what_ happen ed_ when_ we_ test ed_ these_ new_ drugs_ in_ wor ms_ ._

So these are healthy worms,  and you can see they're moving around normally.
So_ these_ are_ hea lt h y_ wor ms_ , \ 3 2 ; \ 3 2 ;_ and_ you_ can_ see_ they_ ' _ re_ mov ing_ around_ nor ma lly_ ._

These worms, on the other hand,  have protein molecules sticking together inside them --  like humans with Alzheimer's.
These_ wor ms_ , \ 3 2 ;_ on_ the_ other_ hand _ , \ 3 2 ; \ 3 2 ;_ have_ prot ei n_ mo lec ul es_ stic king_ together _ inside_ them_ \ 3 2 ; - - \ 3 2 ; \ 3 2 ;_ like_ human s_ with_ Al z he ime r_ ' _ s_ ._

And you can see they're clearly sick.
And_ you_ can_ see_ they_ ' _ re_ clear ly_ si ck_ ._

But if we give our new drugs to these worms at an early stage,  then we see that they're healthy, and they live a normal lifespan.
But_ if_ we_ give _ our_ new_ drugs_ to_ these_ wor ms_ at_ an_ ear ly_ sta ge_ , \ 3 2 ; \ 3 2 ;_ then_ we_ see_ that_ they_ ' _ re_ hea lt h y_ , \ 3 2 ;_ and_ they_ live_ a_ nor ma l_ life spa n_ ._

This is just an initial positive result, but research like this  shows us that Alzheimer's is a disease that we can understand and we can cure.
This_ is_ just_ an_ ini ti al_ pos iti ve_ res ult _ , \ 3 2 ;_ but_ research _ like_ this_ \ 3 2 ; \ 3 2 ;_ sho w s_ us_ that_ Al z he ime r_ ' _ s_ is_ a_ disease _ that_ we_ can_ understand_ and_ we_ can_ cur e_ ._

After 114 years of waiting,  there's finally real hope for what can be achieved  in the next 10 or 20 years.
A ft er_ 1 1 4 _ years_ of_ wa iti ng_ , \ 3 2 ; \ 3 2 ;_ there_ ' _ s_ fin ally_ real _ hope _ for_ what_ can_ be_ ach ie ved_ \ 3 2 ; \ 3 2 ;_ in_ the_ next_ 10_ or_ 20 _ years_ ._

But to grow that hope, to finally beat Alzheimer's, we need help.
But_ to_ grow _ that_ hope _ , \ 3 2 ;_ to_ fin ally_ bea t_ Al z he ime r_ ' _ s_ , \ 3 2 ;_ we_ need_ help_ ._

This isn't about scientists like me --  it's about you.
This_ isn _ ' _ t_ about_ scientist s_ like_ me_ \ 3 2 ; - - \ 3 2 ; \ 3 2 ;_ it_ ' _ s_ about_ you_ ._

We need you to raise awareness that Alzheimer's is a disease  and that if we try, we can beat it.

In the case of other diseases,  patients and their families have led the charge for more research  and put pressure on governments, the pharmaceutical industry,  scientists and regulators.
In_ the_ case _ of_ other_ disease s_ , \ 3 2 ; \ 3 2 ;_ patients _ and_ their_ fa mili es_ have_ led _ the_ ch ar ge_ for_ more_ research _ \ 3 2 ; \ 3 2 ;_ and_ put_ pres sur e_ on_ govern ment s_ , \ 3 2 ;_ the_ ph ar ma ce uti cal _ ind ust ry_ , \ 3 2 ; \ 3 2 ;_ scientist s_ and_ re gu la to rs_ ._

That was essential for advancing treatment for HIV in the late 1980s.

Today, we see that same drive to beat cancer.

But Alzheimer's patients are often unable to speak up for themselves.
But_ Al z he ime r_ ' _ s_ patients _ are_ of ten _ un able_ to_ spe ak _ up_ for_ the ms el ves_ ._

And their families, the hidden victims, caring for their loved ones night and day,  are often too worn out to go out and advocate for change.

So, it really is down to you.

Alzheimer's isn't, for the most part, a genetic disease.

I published this article  in the New York Times Modern Love column in January of this year.
I_ publish ed_ this_ article _ \ 3 2 ; \ 3 2 ;_ in_ the_ N ew _ Y or k_ T imes_ M od er n_ Lo ve_ col um n_ in_ J an ua ry_ of_ this_ year_ ._

"To Fall in Love With Anyone, Do This."
"_ To _ F all_ in_ Lo ve_ W ith _ An yon e_ , \ 3 2 ;_ D o_ This_ ."_

And the article is about a psychological study  designed to create romantic love in the laboratory,  and my own experience trying the study myself  one night last summer.
And_ the_ article _ is_ about_ a_ psych ologi cal _ study_ \ 3 2 ; \ 3 2 ;_ designe d_ to_ create_ romantic_ love_ in_ the_ lab orat ory _ , \ 3 2 ; \ 3 2 ;_ and_ my_ own_ experience _ try ing_ the_ study_ myself_ \ 3 2 ; \ 3 2 ;_ one_ night_ last_ su mm er_ ._

So the procedure is fairly simple:  two strangers take turns asking each other 36 increasingly personal questions  and then they stare into each other's eyes  without speaking for four minutes.
So_ the_ pro ce du re_ is_ fai r ly_ simpl e_ : \ 3 2 ; \ 3 2 ;_ two_ stra nge rs_ take_ tu r ns_ ask ing_ each_ other_ 3 6_ incre as ing ly_ person al_ questions_ \ 3 2 ; \ 3 2 ;_ and_ then_ they_ sta re_ into_ each_ other_ ' _ s_ ey es_ \ 3 2 ; \ 3 2 ;_ without_ spe ak ing_ for_ four_ min ut es_ ._

So here are a couple of sample questions.
So_ here_ are_ a_ cou ple _ of_ sa mp le_ questions_ ._

Number 12: If you could wake up tomorrow having gained any one quality or ability,  what would it be?
N um be r_ 1 2 _ : \ 3 2 ;_ If_ you_ could_ wa ke_ up_ to mor ro w_ havi ng_ ga ine d_ any_ one_ q ual ity_ or_ abilit y_ , \ 3 2 ; \ 3 2 ;_ what_ would_ it_ be_ ?_

Number 28: When did you last cry in front of another person?
N um be r_ 2 8 _ : \ 3 2 ;_ When_ did_ you_ last_ cr y_ in_ front_ of_ another_ person _ ?_

By yourself?
B y_ you rs el f _ ?_

As you can see, they really do get more personal as they go along.
As_ you_ can_ see_ , \ 3 2 ;_ they_ really_ do_ get_ more_ person al_ as_ they_ go_ alon g_ ._

Number 30, I really like this one:  Tell your partner what you like about them;  be very honest this time,  saying things you might not say to someone you just met.
N um be r_ 30 _ , \ 3 2 ;_ I_ really_ like_ this_ one_ : \ 3 2 ; \ 3 2 ;_ T ell _ your_ part ner _ what_ you_ like_ about_ them_ ; \ 3 2 ; \ 3 2 ;_ be_ very_ ho nes t_ this_ time_ , \ 3 2 ; \ 3 2 ;_ say ing_ things_ you_ might_ not_ say_ to_ someone_ you_ just_ met _ ._

So when I first came across this study a few years earlier,  one detail really stuck out to me,  and that was the rumor that two of the participants  had gotten married six months later,  and they'd invited the entire lab to the ceremony.
So_ when_ I_ first_ came_ across_ this_ study_ a_ few_ years_ ear lie r_ , \ 3 2 ; \ 3 2 ;_ one_ de tai l_ really_ stu ck_ out_ to_ me_ , \ 3 2 ; \ 3 2 ;_ and_ that_ was_ the_ ru mor _ that_ two_ of_ the_ part ici pa nt s_ \ 3 2 ; \ 3 2 ;_ had_ go tte n_ ma rr ie d_ si x _ mon ths _ late r_ , \ 3 2 ; \ 3 2 ;_ and_ they_ ' _ d_ inv ite d_ the_ entire _ lab _ to_ the_ cer em on y_ ._

So I was of course very skeptical  about this process of just manufacturing romantic love,  but of course I was intrigued.
So_ I_ was_ of_ cour se_ very_ s ke pt ical_ \ 3 2 ; \ 3 2 ;_ about_ this_ process _ of_ just_ man u fact uri ng_ romantic_ love_ , \ 3 2 ; \ 3 2 ;_ but_ of_ cour se_ I_ was_ int rig ue d_ ._

And when I got the chance to try this study myself,  with someone I knew but not particularly well,  I wasn't expecting to fall in love.
And_ when_ I_ got_ the_ chan ce_ to_ try_ this_ study_ myself_ , \ 3 2 ; \ 3 2 ;_ with_ someone_ I_ k new_ but_ not_ particular ly_ well _ , \ 3 2 ; \ 3 2 ;_ I_ wa s n_ ' _ t_ expe cti ng_ to_ fall _ in_ love_ ._

But then we did, and --    And I thought it made a good story, so I sent it to the Modern Love column  a few months later.
But_ then_ we_ did_ , \ 3 2 ;_ and_ \ 3 2 ; - - \ 3 2 ; \ 3 2 ; \ 3 2 ; \ 3 2 ;_ And_ I_ thought_ it_ made_ a_ good_ story_ , \ 3 2 ;_ so_ I_ se nt_ it_ to_ the_ M od er n_ Lo ve_ col um n_ \ 3 2 ; \ 3 2 ;_ a_ few_ mon ths _ late r_ ._

Now, this was published in January,  and now it is August,  so I'm guessing that some of you are probably wondering,  are we still together?
Now_ , \ 3 2 ;_ this_ was_ publish ed_ in_ J an ua ry_ , \ 3 2 ; \ 3 2 ;_ and_ now_ it_ is_ August _ , \ 3 2 ; \ 3 2 ;_ so_ I_ ' _ m_ gu ess ing_ that_ some_ of_ you_ are_ pro bab ly_ wo nd ering _ , \ 3 2 ; \ 3 2 ;_ are_ we_ still_ together _ ?_

And the reason I think you might be wondering this  is because I have been asked this question  again and again and again for the past seven months.
And_ the_ reason _ I_ think_ you_ might_ be_ wo nd ering _ this_ \ 3 2 ; \ 3 2 ;_ is_ because_ I_ have_ been_ asked_ this_ question_ \ 3 2 ; \ 3 2 ;_ again _ and_ again _ and_ again _ for_ the_ past_ se ven _ mon ths _ ._

And this question is really what I want to talk about today.
And_ this_ question_ is_ really_ what_ I_ want_ to_ talk_ about_ today_ ._

But let's come back to it.
But_ let _ ' _ s_ come_ back_ to_ it_ ._

So the week before the article came out,  I was very nervous.
So_ the_ we e k_ before_ the_ article _ came_ out_ , \ 3 2 ; \ 3 2 ;_ I_ was_ very_ ner vo us_ ._

I had been working on a book about love stories  for the past few years,  so I had gotten used to writing about my own experiences  with romantic love on my blog.
I_ had_ been_ work ing_ on_ a_ bo o k_ about_ love_ stor ies_ \ 3 2 ; \ 3 2 ;_ for_ the_ past_ few_ years_ , \ 3 2 ; \ 3 2 ;_ so_ I_ had_ go tte n_ used_ to_ w rit ing_ about_ my_ own_ experience s_ \ 3 2 ; \ 3 2 ;_ with_ romantic_ love_ on_ my_ blo g_ ._

But a blog post might get a couple hundred views at the most,  and those were usually just my Facebook friends,  and I figured my article in the New York Times  would probably get a few thousand views.
But_ a_ blo g_ pos t_ might_ get_ a_ cou ple _ hu nd red_ views _ at_ the_ most_ , \ 3 2 ; \ 3 2 ;_ and_ those_ were_ us ually_ just_ my_ F ac e bo o k_ friend s_ , \ 3 2 ; \ 3 2 ;_ and_ I_ figure d_ my_ article _ in_ the_ N ew _ Y or k_ T imes_ \ 3 2 ; \ 3 2 ;_ would_ pro bab ly_ get_ a_ few_ thou san d_ views _ ._

And that felt like a lot of attention  on a relatively new relationship.
And_ that_ fe lt _ like_ a_ lot_ of_ att enti on_ \ 3 2 ; \ 3 2 ;_ on_ a_ rel ati vel y_ new_ relationship _ ._

But as it turned out, I had no idea.
But_ as_ it_ turned_ out_ , \ 3 2 ;_ I_ had_ no_ idea_ ._

So the article was published online  on a Friday evening,  and by Saturday, this had happened to the traffic on my blog.
So_ the_ article _ was_ publish ed_ on line _ \ 3 2 ; \ 3 2 ;_ on_ a_ F ri day _ eve ning _ , \ 3 2 ; \ 3 2 ;_ and_ by_ S atur day _ , \ 3 2 ;_ this_ had_ happen ed_ to_ the_ tra ff ic_ on_ my_ blo g_ ._

And by Sunday, both the Today Show and Good Morning America had called.
And_ by_ S und a y_ , \ 3 2 ;_ bot h_ the_ To day _ Sh ow_ and_ G o od_ M or ning _ A mer ica _ had_ called_ ._

Within a month, the article would receive over 8 million views,  and I was, to say the least,  underprepared for this sort of attention.
W ith in_ a_ mon th_ , \ 3 2 ;_ the_ article _ would_ rec ei ve_ over_ 8 _ mil lion _ views _ , \ 3 2 ; \ 3 2 ;_ and_ I_ was_ , \ 3 2 ;_ to_ say_ the_ lea st_ , \ 3 2 ; \ 3 2 ;_ under pre pare d_ for_ this_ sor t_ of_ att enti on_ ._

It's one thing to work up the confidence to write honestly  about your experiences with love,  but it is another thing to discover  that your love life has made international news --    and to realize that people across the world  are genuinely invested in the status of your new relationship.
It_ ' _ s_ one_ thing_ to_ work_ up_ the_ conf ide nce _ to_ write _ ho nes t ly_ \ 3 2 ; \ 3 2 ;_ about_ your_ experience s_ with_ love_ , \ 3 2 ; \ 3 2 ;_ but_ it_ is_ another_ thing_ to_ discover _ \ 3 2 ; \ 3 2 ;_ that_ your_ love_ life_ has_ made_ inter nat ion al_ ne w s_ \ 3 2 ; - - \ 3 2 ; \ 3 2 ; \ 3 2 ; \ 3 2 ;_ and_ to_ real ize _ that_ people_ across_ the_ world_ \ 3 2 ; \ 3 2 ;_ are_ gen u ine ly_ inv est ed_ in_ the_ sta tu s_ of_ your_ new_ relationship _ ._

And when people called or emailed, which they did every day for weeks,  they always asked the same question first:  are you guys still together?
And_ when_ people_ called_ or_ em a il ed_ , \ 3 2 ;_ which_ they_ did_ every_ day _ for_ we e ks _ , \ 3 2 ; \ 3 2 ;_ they_ always_ asked_ the_ same_ question_ first_ : \ 3 2 ; \ 3 2 ;_ are_ you_ gu ys_ still_ together _ ?_

In fact, as I was preparing this talk,  I did a quick search of my email inbox  for the phrase "Are you still together?"
In_ fact _ , \ 3 2 ;_ as_ I_ was_ pre pa ring_ this_ talk_ , \ 3 2 ; \ 3 2 ;_ I_ did_ a_ qui ck_ sea rc h_ of_ my_ em a il _ in box_ \ 3 2 ; \ 3 2 ;_ for_ the_ ph ra se_ \ 3 2 ; "_ Ar e_ you_ still_ together _ ?"_

and several messages popped up immediately.
and_ se ver al_ mes sa ge s_ po pp ed_ up_ im medi ate ly_ ._

They were from students and journalists  and friendly strangers like this one.
They_ were_ from_ students _ and_ j ou rna li sts _ \ 3 2 ; \ 3 2 ;_ and_ friend ly_ stra nge rs_ like_ this_ one_ ._

I did radio interviews and they asked.
I_ did_ radio _ inter views _ and_ they_ asked_ ._

I even gave a talk, and one woman shouted up to the stage,  "Hey Mandy, where's your boyfriend?"
I_ even_ ga ve_ a_ talk_ , \ 3 2 ;_ and_ one_ woman _ sho ut ed_ up_ to_ the_ sta ge_ , \ 3 2 ; \ 3 2 ; "_ He y_ Ma nd y_ , \ 3 2 ;_ where_ ' _ s_ your_ bo y friend _ ?"_

And I promptly turned bright red.
And_ I_ pro mp t ly_ turned_ bri ght _ red_ ._

I understand that this is part of the deal.
I_ understand_ that_ this_ is_ part_ of_ the_ dea l_ ._

If you write about your relationship in an international newspaper,  you should expect people to feel comfortable asking about it.
If_ you_ write _ about_ your_ relationship _ in_ an_ inter nat ion al_ ne w spa per _ , \ 3 2 ; \ 3 2 ;_ you_ should_ expe ct_ people_ to_ feel_ com for table _ ask ing_ about_ it_ ._

But I just wasn't prepared for the scope of the response.
But_ I_ just_ wa s n_ ' _ t_ pre pare d_ for_ the_ sc ope _ of_ the_ res po ns e_ ._

The 36 questions seem to have taken on a life of their own.
The_ 3 6_ questions_ see m_ to_ have_ tak en_ on_ a_ life_ of_ their_ own_ ._

In fact, the New York Times published a follow-up article  for Valentine's Day,  which featured readers' experiences of trying the study themselves,  with varying degrees of success.
In_ fact _ , \ 3 2 ;_ the_ N ew _ Y or k_ T imes_ publish ed_ a_ fol low _ - _ up_ article _ \ 3 2 ; \ 3 2 ;_ for_ V al enti ne_ ' _ s_ D a y_ , \ 3 2 ; \ 3 2 ;_ which_ fe atur ed_ read ers_ ' \ 3 2 ;_ experience s_ of_ try ing_ the_ study_ the ms el ves_ , \ 3 2 ; \ 3 2 ;_ with_ var ying_ de gre es_ of_ su cc ess _ ._

So my first impulse in the face of all of this attention  was to become very protective of my own relationship.
So_ my_ first_ imp ul se_ in_ the_ face _ of_ all_ of_ this_ att enti on_ \ 3 2 ; \ 3 2 ;_ was_ to_ become_ very_ prot ecti ve_ of_ my_ own_ relationship _ ._

I said no to every request for the two of us  to do a media appearance together.
I_ said _ no_ to_ every_ re que st_ for_ the_ two_ of_ us_ \ 3 2 ; \ 3 2 ;_ to_ do_ a_ medi a_ app ear ance_ together _ ._

I turned down TV interviews,  and I said no to every request for photos of the two us.
I_ turned_ down _ T V _ inter views _ , \ 3 2 ; \ 3 2 ;_ and_ I_ said _ no_ to_ every_ re que st_ for_ ph ot os _ of_ the_ two_ us_ ._

I think I was afraid that we would become  inadvertent icons for the process of falling in love,  a position I did not at all feel qualified for.
I_ think_ I_ was_ af rai d_ that_ we_ would_ become_ \ 3 2 ; \ 3 2 ;_ in ad ver tent _ ic ons _ for_ the_ process _ of_ fall ing_ in_ love_ , \ 3 2 ; \ 3 2 ;_ a_ pos ition _ I_ did_ not_ at_ all_ feel_ q ual i fi ed_ for_ ._

And I get it:  people didn't just want to know if the study worked,  they wanted to know if it really worked:  that is, if it was capable of producing love that would last,  not just a fling, but real love, sustainable love.
And_ I_ get_ it_ : \ 3 2 ; \ 3 2 ;_ people_ di d n_ ' _ t_ just_ want_ to_ know_ if_ the_ study_ work ed_ , \ 3 2 ; \ 3 2 ;_ they_ want ed_ to_ know_ if_ it_ really_ work ed_ : \ 3 2 ; \ 3 2 ;_ that_ is_ , \ 3 2 ;_ if_ it_ was_ ca pa ble_ of_ pro duc ing_ love_ that_ would_ last_ , \ 3 2 ; \ 3 2 ;_ not_ just_ a_ fl ing_ , \ 3 2 ;_ but_ real _ love_ , \ 3 2 ;_ su sta in able_ love_ ._

But this was a question I didn't feel capable of answering.
But_ this_ was_ a_ question_ I_ di d n_ ' _ t_ feel_ ca pa ble_ of_ answer ing_ ._

My own relationship was only a few months old,  and I felt like people were asking the wrong question in the first place.
M y_ own_ relationship _ was_ only_ a_ few_ mon ths _ old _ , \ 3 2 ; \ 3 2 ;_ and_ I_ fe lt _ like_ people_ were_ ask ing_ the_ wrong_ question_ in_ the_ first_ place_ ._

What would knowing whether or not we were still together really tell them?
What_ would_ know ing_ whe ther_ or_ not_ we_ were_ still_ together _ really_ tell_ them_ ?_

If the answer was no,  would it make the experience of doing these 36 questions  any less worthwhile?
If_ the_ answer _ was_ no_ , \ 3 2 ; \ 3 2 ;_ would_ it_ make_ the_ experience _ of_ do ing_ these_ 3 6_ questions_ \ 3 2 ; \ 3 2 ;_ any_ less _ wor th while_ ?_

Dr. Arthur Aron first wrote about these questions  in this study here in 1997,  and here, the researcher's goal was not to produce romantic love.
D r_ . \ 3 2 ;_ Ar th ur _ Ar on_ first_ wro te_ about_ these_ questions_ \ 3 2 ; \ 3 2 ;_ in_ this_ study_ here_ in_ 19 9 7 _ , \ 3 2 ; \ 3 2 ;_ and_ here_ , \ 3 2 ;_ the_ research er_ ' _ s_ go al_ was_ not_ to_ produce _ romantic_ love_ ._

Instead, they wanted to foster  interpersonal closeness among college students,  by using what Aron called  "sustained, escalating, reciprocal, personalistic self-disclosure."
In ste ad _ , \ 3 2 ;_ they_ want ed_ to_ fo ste r_ \ 3 2 ; \ 3 2 ;_ inter person al_ close nes s_ am ong _ colle ge_ students _ , \ 3 2 ; \ 3 2 ;_ by_ using_ what_ Ar on_ called_ \ 3 2 ; \ 3 2 ; "_ su sta ine d_ , \ 3 2 ;_ es cal ati ng_ , \ 3 2 ;_ rec i pro cal _ , \ 3 2 ;_ person ali stic _ self _ - _ dis cl os ure_ ."_

Sounds romantic, doesn't it?
So und s_ romantic_ , \ 3 2 ;_ does n_ ' _ t_ it_ ?_

But the study did work.
But_ the_ study_ did_ work_ ._

The participants did feel closer after doing it,  and several subsequent studies have also used Aron's fast friends protocol  as a way to quickly create trust and intimacy between strangers.
The_ part ici pa nt s_ did_ feel_ close r_ after_ do ing_ it_ , \ 3 2 ; \ 3 2 ;_ and_ se ver al_ su b se que nt_ stu die s_ have_ also_ used_ Ar on_ ' _ s_ fa st_ friend s_ prot oc ol _ \ 3 2 ; \ 3 2 ;_ as_ a_ way_ to_ qui ckl y_ create_ tru st_ and_ int im ac y_ between_ stra nge rs_ ._

They've used it between members of the police and members of community,  and they've used it between people of opposing political ideologies.
They_ ' _ ve_ used_ it_ between_ me mber s_ of_ the_ po lic e_ and_ me mber s_ of_ communi ty_ , \ 3 2 ; \ 3 2 ;_ and_ they_ ' _ ve_ used_ it_ between_ people_ of_ op pos ing_ po lit ical_ ide ologi es_ ._

The original version of the story,  the one that I tried last summer,  that pairs the personal questions with four minutes of eye contact,  was referenced in this article,  but unfortunately it was never published.
The_ ori gi na l_ vers ion_ of_ the_ story_ , \ 3 2 ; \ 3 2 ;_ the_ one_ that_ I_ tri ed_ last_ su mm er_ , \ 3 2 ; \ 3 2 ;_ that_ pa ir s_ the_ person al_ questions_ with_ four_ min ut es_ of_ ey e_ conta ct_ , \ 3 2 ; \ 3 2 ;_ was_ ref eren ce d_ in_ this_ article _ , \ 3 2 ; \ 3 2 ;_ but_ un for tu nat el y_ it_ was_ never_ publish ed_ ._

So a few months ago, I was giving a talk  at a small liberal arts college,  and a student came up to me afterwards  and he said, kind of shyly,  "So, I tried your study, and it didn't work."
So_ a_ few_ mon ths _ ago _ , \ 3 2 ;_ I_ was_ gi vi ng_ a_ talk_ \ 3 2 ; \ 3 2 ;_ at_ a_ small_ li be ra l_ art s_ colle ge_ , \ 3 2 ; \ 3 2 ;_ and_ a_ stu den t_ came_ up_ to_ me_ af ter ward s_ \ 3 2 ; \ 3 2 ;_ and_ he_ said _ , \ 3 2 ;_ kind_ of_ s h y ly_ , \ 3 2 ; \ 3 2 ; "_ So_ , \ 3 2 ;_ I_ tri ed_ your_ study_ , \ 3 2 ;_ and_ it_ di d n_ ' _ t_ work_ ."_

He seemed a little mystified by this.
He _ see med_ a_ little_ my sti fi ed_ by_ this_ ._

"You mean, you didn't fall in love with the person you did it with?" I asked.
"_ You_ mean _ , \ 3 2 ;_ you_ di d n_ ' _ t_ fall _ in_ love_ with_ the_ person _ you_ did_ it_ with_ ? " \ 3 2 ;_ I_ asked_ ._

"Well..." He paused.
"_ We ll_ . . . " \ 3 2 ;_ He _ pa used_ ._

"I think she just wants to be friends."
"_ I_ think_ she_ just_ want s_ to_ be_ friend s_ ."_

"But did you become better friends?" I asked.
"_ But_ did_ you_ become_ better_ friend s_ ? " \ 3 2 ;_ I_ asked_ ._

"Did you feel like you got to really know each other after doing the study?"
"_ D i d_ you_ feel_ like_ you_ got_ to_ really_ know_ each_ other_ after_ do ing_ the_ study_ ?"_

He nodded.
He _ no d ded _ ._

"So, then it worked," I said.
"_ So_ , \ 3 2 ;_ then_ it_ work ed_ , " \ 3 2 ;_ I_ said _ ._

I don't think this is the answer he was looking for.
I_ do n_ ' _ t_ think_ this_ is_ the_ answer _ he_ was_ look ing_ for_ ._

In fact, I don't think this is the answer that any of us are looking for  when it comes to love.
In_ fact _ , \ 3 2 ;_ I_ do n_ ' _ t_ think_ this_ is_ the_ answer _ that_ any_ of_ us_ are_ look ing_ for_ \ 3 2 ; \ 3 2 ;_ when_ it_ com es_ to_ love_ ._

I first came across this study when I was 29  and I was going through a really difficult breakup.
I_ first_ came_ across_ this_ study_ when_ I_ was_ 2 9 _ \ 3 2 ; \ 3 2 ;_ and_ I_ was_ going_ through_ a_ really_ diff ic ult _ brea k up_ ._

I had been in the relationship since I was 20,  which was basically my entire adult life,  and he was my first real love,  and I had no idea how or if I could make a life without him.
I_ had_ been_ in_ the_ relationship _ si nce _ I_ was_ 20 _ , \ 3 2 ; \ 3 2 ;_ which_ was_ ba si cally _ my_ entire _ adult _ life_ , \ 3 2 ; \ 3 2 ;_ and_ he_ was_ my_ first_ real _ love_ , \ 3 2 ; \ 3 2 ;_ and_ I_ had_ no_ idea_ how_ or_ if_ I_ could_ make_ a_ life_ without_ hi m_ ._

So I turned to science.
So_ I_ turned_ to_ sci ence_ ._

I researched everything I could find about the science of romantic love,  and I think I was hoping that it might somehow inoculate me from heartache.
I_ research ed_ everything_ I_ could_ find_ about_ the_ sci ence_ of_ romantic_ love_ , \ 3 2 ; \ 3 2 ;_ and_ I_ think_ I_ was_ ho pi ng_ that_ it_ might_ some how_ in oc ul ate_ me_ from_ hear ta che _ ._

I don't know if I realized this at the time --  I thought I was just doing research for this book I was writing --  but it seems really obvious in retrospect.
I_ do n_ ' _ t_ know_ if_ I_ realized _ this_ at_ the_ time_ \ 3 2 ; - - \ 3 2 ; \ 3 2 ;_ I_ thought_ I_ was_ just_ do ing_ research _ for_ this_ bo o k_ I_ was_ w rit ing_ \ 3 2 ; - - \ 3 2 ; \ 3 2 ;_ but_ it_ see ms_ really_ ob vi ous_ in_ re t ro spec t_ ._

I hoped that if I armed myself with the knowledge of romantic love,  I might never have to feel as terrible and lonely as I did then.
I_ hope d_ that_ if_ I_ armed_ myself_ with_ the_ know led ge_ of_ romantic_ love_ , \ 3 2 ; \ 3 2 ;_ I_ might_ never_ have_ to_ feel_ as_ terr ible_ and_ lo ne ly_ as_ I_ did_ then_ ._

And all this knowledge has been useful in some ways.
And_ all_ this_ know led ge_ has_ been_ use ful_ in_ some_ way s_ ._

I am more patient with love. I am more relaxed.
I_ am_ more_ pat ie nt_ with_ love_ . \ 3 2 ;_ I_ am_ more_ rel a x ed_ ._

I am more confident about asking for what I want.
I_ am_ more_ conf ident _ about_ ask ing_ for_ what_ I_ want_ ._

But I can also see myself more clearly,  and I can see that what I want is sometimes more  than can reasonably be asked for.
But_ I_ can_ also_ see_ myself_ more_ clear ly_ , \ 3 2 ; \ 3 2 ;_ and_ I_ can_ see_ that_ what_ I_ want_ is_ somet imes_ more_ \ 3 2 ; \ 3 2 ;_ than_ can_ reason abl y_ be_ asked_ for_ ._

What I want from love is a guarantee,  not just that I am loved today  and that I will be loved tomorrow,  but that I will continue to be loved by the person I love indefinitely.
What_ I_ want_ from_ love_ is_ a_ gu ar ant ee _ , \ 3 2 ; \ 3 2 ;_ not_ just_ that_ I_ am_ love d_ today_ \ 3 2 ; \ 3 2 ;_ and_ that_ I_ will_ be_ love d_ to mor ro w_ , \ 3 2 ; \ 3 2 ;_ but_ that_ I_ will_ continu e_ to_ be_ love d_ by_ the_ person _ I_ love_ ind e fin ite ly_ ._

Maybe it's this possibility of a guarantee  that people were really asking about  when they wanted to know if we were still together.
Ma y be_ it_ ' _ s_ this_ possib ili ty_ of_ a_ gu ar ant ee _ \ 3 2 ; \ 3 2 ;_ that_ people_ were_ really_ ask ing_ about_ \ 3 2 ; \ 3 2 ;_ when_ they_ want ed_ to_ know_ if_ we_ were_ still_ together _ ._

So the story that the media told about the 36 questions  was that there might be a shortcut to falling in love.
So_ the_ story_ that_ the_ medi a_ to ld _ about_ the_ 3 6_ questions_ \ 3 2 ; \ 3 2 ;_ was_ that_ there_ might_ be_ a_ sho rt cu t_ to_ fall ing_ in_ love_ ._

There might be a way to somehow mitigate some of the risk involved,  and this is a very appealing story,  because falling in love feels amazing,  but it's also terrifying.
There_ might_ be_ a_ way_ to_ some how_ mi ti ga te_ some_ of_ the_ ris k_ inv ol ved_ , \ 3 2 ; \ 3 2 ;_ and_ this_ is_ a_ very_ app ea lin g_ story_ , \ 3 2 ; \ 3 2 ;_ because_ fall ing_ in_ love_ fe els _ am azin g_ , \ 3 2 ; \ 3 2 ;_ but_ it_ ' _ s_ also_ terr ify ing_ ._

The moment you admit to loving someone,  you admit to having a lot to lose,  and it's true that these questions do provide a mechanism  for getting to know someone quickly,  which is also a mechanism for being known,  and I think this is the thing that most of us really want from love:  to be known, to be seen, to be understood.
The_ mo ment_ you_ ad mi t_ to_ lo vi ng_ someone_ , \ 3 2 ; \ 3 2 ;_ you_ ad mi t_ to_ havi ng_ a_ lot_ to_ los e_ , \ 3 2 ; \ 3 2 ;_ and_ it_ ' _ s_ true _ that_ these_ questions_ do_ provi de_ a_ me chan ism _ \ 3 2 ; \ 3 2 ;_ for_ get ting_ to_ know_ someone_ qui ckl y_ , \ 3 2 ; \ 3 2 ;_ which_ is_ also_ a_ me chan ism _ for_ being_ know n_ , \ 3 2 ; \ 3 2 ;_ and_ I_ think_ this_ is_ the_ thing_ that_ most_ of_ us_ really_ want_ from_ love_ : \ 3 2 ; \ 3 2 ;_ to_ be_ know n_ , \ 3 2 ;_ to_ be_ see n_ , \ 3 2 ;_ to_ be_ under sto od_ ._

But I think when it comes to love,  we are too willing to accept the short version of the story.
But_ I_ think_ when_ it_ com es_ to_ love_ , \ 3 2 ; \ 3 2 ;_ we_ are_ too_ wi lli ng_ to_ acce pt _ the_ sho rt_ vers ion_ of_ the_ story_ ._

The version of the story that asks, "Are you still together?"
The_ vers ion_ of_ the_ story_ that_ ask s_ , \ 3 2 ; "_ Ar e_ you_ still_ together _ ?"_

and is content with a yes or no answer.
and_ is_ con tent _ with_ a_ ye s_ or_ no_ answer _ ._

So rather than that question,  I would propose we ask some more difficult questions,  questions like:  How do you decide who deserves your love and who does not?
So_ rat her_ than_ that_ question_ , \ 3 2 ; \ 3 2 ;_ I_ would_ pro pos e_ we_ ask_ some_ more_ diff ic ult _ questions_ , \ 3 2 ; \ 3 2 ;_ questions_ like_ : \ 3 2 ; \ 3 2 ;_ How _ do_ you_ deci de_ who_ des erv es_ your_ love_ and_ who_ does _ not_ ?_

How do you stay in love when things get difficult,  and how do you know when to just cut and run?
How _ do_ you_ sta y_ in_ love_ when_ things_ get_ diff ic ult _ , \ 3 2 ; \ 3 2 ;_ and_ how_ do_ you_ know_ when_ to_ just_ cu t_ and_ ru n_ ?_

How do you live with the doubt  that inevitably creeps into every relationship,  or even harder,  how do you live with your partner's doubt?
How _ do_ you_ live_ with_ the_ do u b t_ \ 3 2 ; \ 3 2 ;_ that_ ine vit abl y_ cre ep s_ into_ every_ relationship _ , \ 3 2 ; \ 3 2 ;_ or_ even_ hard er_ , \ 3 2 ; \ 3 2 ;_ how_ do_ you_ live_ with_ your_ part ner _ ' _ s_ do u b t_ ?_

I don't necessarily know the answers to these questions,  but I think they're an important start at having a more thoughtful conversation  about what it means to love someone.
I_ do n_ ' _ t_ ne ces sa ri ly_ know_ the_ answer s_ to_ these_ questions_ , \ 3 2 ; \ 3 2 ;_ but_ I_ think_ they_ ' _ re_ an_ impo rt ant _ start _ at_ havi ng_ a_ more_ thou ght ful_ con vers ation_ \ 3 2 ; \ 3 2 ;_ about_ what_ it_ mean s_ to_ love_ someone_ ._

So, if you want it,  the short version of the story of my relationship is this:  a year ago, an acquaintance and I did a study  designed to create romantic love,  and we fell in love,  and we are still together,  and I am so glad.
So_ , \ 3 2 ;_ if_ you_ want_ it_ , \ 3 2 ; \ 3 2 ;_ the_ sho rt_ vers ion_ of_ the_ story_ of_ my_ relationship _ is_ this_ : \ 3 2 ; \ 3 2 ;_ a_ year_ ago _ , \ 3 2 ;_ an_ ac q ua int ance_ and_ I_ did_ a_ study_ \ 3 2 ; \ 3 2 ;_ designe d_ to_ create_ romantic_ love_ , \ 3 2 ; \ 3 2 ;_ and_ we_ fe ll_ in_ love_ , \ 3 2 ; \ 3 2 ;_ and_ we_ are_ still_ together _ , \ 3 2 ; \ 3 2 ;_ and_ I_ am_ so_ gl ad _ ._

But falling in love is not the same thing as staying in love.
But_ fall ing_ in_ love_ is_ not_ the_ same_ thing_ as_ sta ying_ in_ love_ ._

Falling in love is the easy part.
F all ing_ in_ love_ is_ the_ eas y_ part_ ._

So at the end of my article, I wrote, "Love didn't happen to us.
So_ at_ the_ end _ of_ my_ article _ , \ 3 2 ;_ I_ wro te_ , \ 3 2 ; "_ Lo ve_ di d n_ ' _ t_ happen _ to_ us_ ._

We're in love because we each made the choice to be."
We_ ' _ re_ in_ love_ because_ we_ each_ made_ the_ choice _ to_ be_ ."_

And I cringe a little when I read that now,  not because it isn't true,  but because at the time, I really hadn't considered  everything that was contained in that choice.
And_ I_ cr ing e_ a_ little_ when_ I_ read _ that_ now_ , \ 3 2 ; \ 3 2 ;_ not_ because_ it_ isn _ ' _ t_ true _ , \ 3 2 ; \ 3 2 ;_ but_ because_ at_ the_ time_ , \ 3 2 ;_ I_ really_ ha d n_ ' _ t_ consider ed_ \ 3 2 ; \ 3 2 ;_ everything_ that_ was_ conta ine d_ in_ that_ choice _ ._

I didn't consider how many times we would each have to make that choice,  and how many times I will continue to have to make that choice  without knowing whether or not he will always choose me.
I_ di d n_ ' _ t_ consider _ how_ many_ time s_ we_ would_ each_ have_ to_ make_ that_ choice _ , \ 3 2 ; \ 3 2 ;_ and_ how_ many_ time s_ I_ will_ continu e_ to_ have_ to_ make_ that_ choice _ \ 3 2 ; \ 3 2 ;_ without_ know ing_ whe ther_ or_ not_ he_ will_ always_ cho ose _ me_ ._

I want it to be enough to have asked and answered 36 questions,  and to have chosen to love someone so generous and kind and fun  and to have broadcast that choice in the biggest newspaper in America.
I_ want_ it_ to_ be_ en ou gh _ to_ have_ asked_ and_ answer ed_ 3 6_ questions_ , \ 3 2 ; \ 3 2 ;_ and_ to_ have_ cho se n_ to_ love_ someone_ so_ gener ous_ and_ kind_ and_ fu n_ \ 3 2 ; \ 3 2 ;_ and_ to_ have_ bro ad ca st_ that_ choice _ in_ the_ bi gg est_ ne w spa per _ in_ A mer ica _ ._

But what I have done instead is turn my relationship  into the kind of myth I don't quite believe in.
But_ what_ I_ have_ do ne_ inst ead_ is_ tu r n_ my_ relationship _ \ 3 2 ; \ 3 2 ;_ into_ the_ kind_ of_ my th_ I_ do n_ ' _ t_ qui te_ believe_ in_ ._

And what I want, what perhaps I will spend my life wanting,  is for that myth to be true.
And_ what_ I_ want_ , \ 3 2 ;_ what_ per ha p s_ I_ will_ spe nd_ my_ life_ want ing_ , \ 3 2 ; \ 3 2 ;_ is_ for_ that_ my th_ to_ be_ true _ ._

I want the happy ending implied by the title to my article,  which is, incidentally,  the only part of the article that I didn't actually write.
I_ want_ the_ ha pp y_ end ing_ imp lie d_ by_ the_ ti tle _ to_ my_ article _ , \ 3 2 ; \ 3 2 ;_ which_ is_ , \ 3 2 ;_ inc ident ally_ , \ 3 2 ; \ 3 2 ;_ the_ only_ part_ of_ the_ article _ that_ I_ di d n_ ' _ t_ act ually_ write _ ._

But what I have instead is the chance to make the choice to love someone,  and the hope that he will choose to love me back,  and it is terrifying, but that's the deal with love.
But_ what_ I_ have_ inst ead_ is_ the_ chan ce_ to_ make_ the_ choice _ to_ love_ someone_ , \ 3 2 ; \ 3 2 ;_ and_ the_ hope _ that_ he_ will_ cho ose _ to_ love_ me_ back_ , \ 3 2 ; \ 3 2 ;_ and_ it_ is_ terr ify ing_ , \ 3 2 ;_ but_ that_ ' _ s_ the_ dea l_ with_ love_ ._

Thank you.
Thank_ you_ ._

I was raised by lesbians in the mountains,  and I sort of came like a forest gnome to New York City a while back.
I_ was_ rais ed_ by_ les bi an s_ in_ the_ mo un tai ns_ , \ 3 2 ; \ 3 2 ;_ and_ I_ sor t_ of_ came_ like_ a_ fore st_ g no me_ to_ N ew _ Y or k_ C ity_ a_ while_ back_ ._

Really messed with my head, but I'll get into that later.
R ea lly_ mes sed _ with_ my_ head _ , \ 3 2 ;_ but_ I_ ' _ ll_ get_ into_ that_ late r_ ._

I'll start with when I was eight years old.
I_ ' _ ll_ start _ with_ when_ I_ was_ ei ght _ years_ old _ ._

I took a wood box,  and I buried a dollar bill, a pen and a fork inside this box in Colorado.
I_ too k_ a_ wo od_ box_ , \ 3 2 ; \ 3 2 ;_ and_ I_ bu rie d_ a_ do lla r_ bil l_ , \ 3 2 ;_ a_ pe n_ and_ a_ for k_ inside_ this_ box_ in_ Co lo ra do_ ._

And I thought some strange humanoids or aliens in 500 years would find this box  and learn about the way our species exchanged ideas,  maybe how we ate our spaghetti.
And_ I_ thought_ some_ stra nge _ human oi ds_ or_ ali en s_ in_ 50 0_ years_ would_ find_ this_ box_ \ 3 2 ; \ 3 2 ;_ and_ learn _ about_ the_ way_ our_ speci es_ ex change d_ idea s_ , \ 3 2 ; \ 3 2 ;_ may be_ how_ we_ ate_ our_ spa gh et ti _ ._

I really didn't know.
I_ really_ di d n_ ' _ t_ know_ ._

Anyway, this is kind of funny,  because here I am, 30 years later, and I'm still making boxes.
An y way_ , \ 3 2 ;_ this_ is_ kind_ of_ fu n n y_ , \ 3 2 ; \ 3 2 ;_ because_ here_ I_ am_ , \ 3 2 ;_ 30 _ years_ late r_ , \ 3 2 ;_ and_ I_ ' _ m_ still_ ma king_ box es_ ._

Now, at some point I was in Hawaii --  I like to hike and surf and do all that weird stuff,  and I was making a collage for my ma.
Now_ , \ 3 2 ;_ at_ some_ point _ I_ was_ in_ Ha wa i i _ \ 3 2 ; - - \ 3 2 ; \ 3 2 ;_ I_ like_ to_ hi ke_ and_ sur f _ and_ do_ all_ that_ we ird_ stu ff _ , \ 3 2 ; \ 3 2 ;_ and_ I_ was_ ma king_ a_ col la ge_ for_ my_ ma _ ._

And I took a dictionary and I ripped it up,  and I made it into a sort of Agnes Martin grid,  and I poured resin all over it and a bee got stuck.
And_ I_ too k_ a_ dic tion ar y_ and_ I_ ri pp ed_ it_ up_ , \ 3 2 ; \ 3 2 ;_ and_ I_ made_ it_ into_ a_ sor t_ of_ A g nes _ Ma rt in_ gr i d_ , \ 3 2 ; \ 3 2 ;_ and_ I_ po ure d_ resi n_ all_ over_ it_ and_ a_ be e_ got_ stu ck_ ._

Now, she's afraid of bees and she's allergic to them,  so I poured more resin on the canvas, thinking I could hide it or something.
Now_ , \ 3 2 ;_ she_ ' _ s_ af rai d_ of_ be es_ and_ she_ ' _ s_ all er gi c_ to_ them_ , \ 3 2 ; \ 3 2 ;_ so_ I_ po ure d_ more_ resi n_ on_ the_ can va s_ , \ 3 2 ;_ thinking_ I_ could_ hi de_ it_ or_ something_ ._

Instead, the opposite happened:  It sort of created a magnification,  like a magnifying glass, on the dictionary text.
In ste ad _ , \ 3 2 ;_ the_ op pos ite _ happen ed_ : \ 3 2 ; \ 3 2 ;_ It_ sor t_ of_ create d_ a_ mag ni fi cat ion_ , \ 3 2 ; \ 3 2 ;_ like_ a_ mag ni f ying_ gl as s_ , \ 3 2 ;_ on_ the_ dic tion ar y_ te x t_ ._

So what did I do? I built more boxes.
So_ what_ did_ I_ do_ ? \ 3 2 ;_ I_ built _ more_ box es_ ._

This time, I started putting electronics, frogs,  strange bottles I'd find in the street -- anything I could find --  because I was always finding things my whole life,  and trying to make relationships and tell stories between these objects.
This_ time_ , \ 3 2 ;_ I_ started_ pu tt ing_ ele ct ron ic s_ , \ 3 2 ;_ fr og s_ , \ 3 2 ; \ 3 2 ;_ stra nge _ bot tle s_ I_ ' _ d_ find_ in_ the_ stre et_ \ 3 2 ; - - \ 3 2 ;_ any thing_ I_ could_ find_ \ 3 2 ; - - \ 3 2 ; \ 3 2 ;_ because_ I_ was_ always_ fin ding_ things_ my_ who le_ life_ , \ 3 2 ; \ 3 2 ;_ and_ try ing_ to_ make_ relationship s_ and_ tell_ stor ies_ between_ these_ object s_ ._

So I started drawing around the objects,  and I realized: Holy moly, I can draw in space!
So_ I_ started_ draw ing_ around_ the_ object s_ , \ 3 2 ; \ 3 2 ;_ and_ I_ realized _ : \ 3 2 ;_ Ho ly_ mo ly_ , \ 3 2 ;_ I_ can_ draw _ in_ spa ce_ ! _

I can make free-floating lines,  like the way you would draw around a dead body at a crime scene.
I_ can_ make_ free _ - _ fl o ati ng_ line s_ , \ 3 2 ; \ 3 2 ;_ like_ the_ way_ you_ would_ draw _ around_ a_ dea d_ body_ at_ a_ cr ime _ sc en e_ ._

So I took the objects out,  and I created my own taxonomy of invented specimens.
So_ I_ too k_ the_ object s_ out_ , \ 3 2 ; \ 3 2 ;_ and_ I_ create d_ my_ own_ ta x on om y_ of_ invent ed_ speci men s_ ._

First, botanical -- which you can kind of get a sense of.
F ir st_ , \ 3 2 ;_ bot an ical_ \ 3 2 ; - - \ 3 2 ;_ which_ you_ can_ kind_ of_ get_ a_ sens e_ of_ ._

Then I made some weird insects and creatures.
The n_ I_ made_ some_ we ird_ ins ect s_ and_ cre atur es_ ._

It was really fun; I was just drawing on the layers of resin.
It_ was_ really_ fu n_ ; \ 3 2 ;_ I_ was_ just_ draw ing_ on_ the_ la ye rs_ of_ resi n_ ._

And it was cool, because I was actually starting to have shows and stuff,  I was making some money, I could take my girlfriend for dinner,  and like, go to Sizzler.
And_ it_ was_ coo l_ , \ 3 2 ;_ because_ I_ was_ act ually_ start ing_ to_ have_ sho w s_ and_ stu ff _ , \ 3 2 ; \ 3 2 ;_ I_ was_ ma king_ some_ mon ey _ , \ 3 2 ;_ I_ could_ take_ my_ gi r lf rie nd_ for_ di n ner _ , \ 3 2 ; \ 3 2 ;_ and_ like_ , \ 3 2 ;_ go_ to_ S i z z ler _ ._

It was some good shit, man.
It_ was_ some_ good_ shi t_ , \ 3 2 ;_ man _ ._

At some point, I got up to the human form,  life-size resin sculptures with drawings of humans inside the layers.
A t_ some_ point _ , \ 3 2 ;_ I_ got_ up_ to_ the_ human_ form_ , \ 3 2 ; \ 3 2 ;_ life_ - _ si ze _ resi n_ sc ul pt ure s_ with_ draw ing s_ of_ human s_ inside_ the_ la ye rs_ ._

This was great, except for one thing:  I was going to die.
This_ was_ gre at_ , \ 3 2 ;_ ex ce pt _ for_ one_ thing_ : \ 3 2 ; \ 3 2 ;_ I_ was_ going_ to_ die _ ._

I didn't know what to do, because the resin was going to kill me.
I_ di d n_ ' _ t_ know_ what_ to_ do_ , \ 3 2 ;_ because_ the_ resi n_ was_ going_ to_ ki ll_ me_ ._

And I went to bed every night thinking about it.
And_ I_ we nt_ to_ be d_ every_ night_ thinking_ about_ it_ ._

So I tried using glass.
So_ I_ tri ed_ using_ gl as s_ ._

I started drawing on the layers of glass,  almost like if you drew on a window, then you put another window,  and another window, and you had all these windows together  that made a three-dimensional composition.
I_ started_ draw ing_ on_ the_ la ye rs_ of_ gl as s_ , \ 3 2 ; \ 3 2 ;_ al most_ like_ if_ you_ dre w_ on_ a_ window _ , \ 3 2 ;_ then_ you_ put_ another_ window _ , \ 3 2 ; \ 3 2 ;_ and_ another_ window _ , \ 3 2 ;_ and_ you_ had_ all_ these_ window s_ together _ \ 3 2 ; \ 3 2 ;_ that_ made_ a_ three_ - _ di men sion al_ comp os ition _ ._

And this really worked, because I could stop using the resin.
And_ this_ really_ work ed_ , \ 3 2 ;_ because_ I_ could_ sto p_ using_ the_ resi n_ ._

So I did this for years,  which culminated in a very large work, which I call "The Triptych."
So_ I_ did_ this_ for_ years_ , \ 3 2 ; \ 3 2 ;_ which_ cul min ated _ in_ a_ very_ large _ work_ , \ 3 2 ;_ which_ I_ call_ \ 3 2 ; "_ The_ T ri pt y ch_ ."_

"The Triptych" was largely inspired  by Hieronymus Bosch's "[The] Garden of Earthly Delights,"  which is a painting in the [Museo del] Prado in Spain.
"_ The_ T ri pt y ch_ " \ 3 2 ;_ was_ large ly_ ins pir ed_ \ 3 2 ; \ 3 2 ;_ by_ H ie ron y mus _ B os ch_ ' _ s_ \ 3 2 ; " [ _ The_ ] \ 3 2 ;_ G ar den _ of_ Earth ly_ D el ight s_ , " \ 3 2 ; \ 3 2 ;_ which_ is_ a_ pain ting_ in_ the_ \ 3 2 ; [ _ M use o_ del _ ] \ 3 2 ;_ P ra do_ in_ S pain _ ._

Do you guys know this painting?
D o_ you_ gu ys_ know_ this_ pain ting_ ?_

Good, it's a cool painting.
G o od_ , \ 3 2 ;_ it_ ' _ s_ a_ coo l_ pain ting_ ._

It's kind of ahead of its time, they say.
It_ ' _ s_ kind_ of_ ah ead_ of_ its_ time_ , \ 3 2 ;_ they_ say_ ._

So, "The Triptych." I'll walk you through this piece.
So_ , \ 3 2 ; "_ The_ T ri pt y ch_ . " \ 3 2 ;_ I_ ' _ ll_ wal k_ you_ through_ this_ piece _ ._

It weighs 24,000 pounds.
It_ we ig h s_ 2 4 _ ,_ 00 0_ po und s_ ._

It's 18 feet long.
It_ ' _ s_ 1 8 _ fe et_ long _ ._

It's double-sided, so it's 36 feet of composition.
It_ ' _ s_ do u ble_ - _ si ded _ , \ 3 2 ;_ so_ it_ ' _ s_ 3 6_ fe et_ of_ comp os ition _ ._

It's kind of weird.
It_ ' _ s_ kind_ of_ we ird_ ._

Well, that's the blood fountain.
We ll_ , \ 3 2 ;_ that_ ' _ s_ the_ blo od_ fo un tai n_ ._

To the left, you have Jesus and the locusts.
To _ the_ le ft _ , \ 3 2 ;_ you_ have_ J es us_ and_ the_ lo cus ts_ ._

There's a cave  where all these animal-headed creatures travel between two worlds.
There_ ' _ s_ a_ ca ve_ \ 3 2 ; \ 3 2 ;_ where_ all_ these_ an im al_ - _ head ed_ cre atur es_ tra vel _ between_ two_ world s_ ._

They go from the representational world,  to this analog-mesh underworld, where they're hiding.
They_ go_ from_ the_ repr es ent ation al_ world_ , \ 3 2 ; \ 3 2 ;_ to_ this_ an al og _ - _ mes h_ under world_ , \ 3 2 ;_ where_ they_ ' _ re_ hi ding_ ._

This is where the animal-headed creatures are by the lighthouse,  and they're all about to commit mass suicide into the ocean.
This_ is_ where_ the_ an im al_ - _ head ed_ cre atur es_ are_ by_ the_ light ho use _ , \ 3 2 ; \ 3 2 ;_ and_ they_ ' _ re_ all_ about_ to_ comm it_ mas s_ su ici de_ into_ the_ ocean _ ._

The ocean is made up of thousands of elements.
The_ ocean _ is_ made_ up_ of_ thou san ds_ of_ ele ment s_ ._

This is a bird god tied up to a battleship.
This_ is_ a_ bi rd _ go d_ tie d_ up_ to_ a_ ba tt les hi p_ ._

Billy Graham is in the ocean;  the Horizon from the oil spill; Waldo; Osama Bin Laden's shelter --  there's all kinds of weird stuff that you can find  if you look really hard, in the ocean.
B il ly_ G ra ha m_ is_ in_ the_ ocean _ ; \ 3 2 ; \ 3 2 ;_ the_ Ho ri z on_ from_ the_ oi l_ spi ll_ ; \ 3 2 ;_ W al do_ ; \ 3 2 ;_ O sa ma _ B in_ L ade n_ ' _ s_ she lt er_ \ 3 2 ; - - \ 3 2 ; \ 3 2 ;_ there_ ' _ s_ all_ ki nds _ of_ we ird_ stu ff _ that_ you_ can_ find_ \ 3 2 ; \ 3 2 ;_ if_ you_ look_ really_ hard _ , \ 3 2 ;_ in_ the_ ocean _ ._

Anyway, this is a lady creature.
An y way_ , \ 3 2 ;_ this_ is_ a_ la d y_ cre atur e_ ._

She's coming out of the ocean, and she's spitting oil into one hand  and she has clouds coming out of her other hand.
Sh e_ ' _ s_ com ing_ out_ of_ the_ ocean _ , \ 3 2 ;_ and_ she_ ' _ s_ spi tt ing_ oi l_ into_ one_ hand _ \ 3 2 ; \ 3 2 ;_ and_ she_ has_ cloud s_ com ing_ out_ of_ her_ other_ hand _ ._

Her hands are like scales,  and she has the mythological reference of the Earth and cosmos in balance.
He r_ hand s_ are_ like_ scale s_ , \ 3 2 ; \ 3 2 ;_ and_ she_ has_ the_ my th ologi cal _ ref eren ce_ of_ the_ Earth _ and_ co sm os _ in_ ba lan ce_ ._

So that's one side of "The Triptych."
So_ that_ ' _ s_ one_ side_ of_ \ 3 2 ; "_ The_ T ri pt y ch_ ."_

It's a little narrative thing.
It_ ' _ s_ a_ little_ na rr ati ve_ thing_ ._

That's her hand that she's spitting into.
Th at_ ' _ s_ her_ hand _ that_ she_ ' _ s_ spi tt ing_ into_ ._

And then, when you go to the other side,  she has like a trunk, like a bird's beak,  and she's spitting clouds out of her trunk.
And_ then_ , \ 3 2 ;_ when_ you_ go_ to_ the_ other_ side_ , \ 3 2 ; \ 3 2 ;_ she_ has_ like_ a_ tru nk _ , \ 3 2 ;_ like_ a_ bi rd _ ' _ s_ bea k_ , \ 3 2 ; \ 3 2 ;_ and_ she_ ' _ s_ spi tt ing_ cloud s_ out_ of_ her_ tru nk _ ._

Then she has an 18-foot-long serpent's tail that connects "The Triptych."
The n_ she_ has_ an_ 1 8 _ - _ fo ot _ - _ long _ ser pe nt_ ' _ s_ tai l_ that_ con ne ct s_ \ 3 2 ; "_ The_ T ri pt y ch_ ."_

Anyway, her tail catches on fire from the back of the volcano.
An y way_ , \ 3 2 ;_ her_ tai l_ cat ches _ on_ fi re_ from_ the_ back_ of_ the_ vo l can o_ ._

I don't know why that happened.
I_ do n_ ' _ t_ know_ wh y_ that_ happen ed_ ._

That happens, you know.
Th at_ happen s_ , \ 3 2 ;_ you_ know_ ._

Her tail terminates in a cycloptic eyeball,  made out of 1986 terrorist cards.
He r_ tai l_ ter min ate s_ in_ a_ cy cl op tic_ ey e ba ll_ , \ 3 2 ; \ 3 2 ;_ made_ out_ of_ 19 8 6_ terr ori st_ car ds_ ._

Have you guys seen those?
Ha ve_ you_ gu ys_ see n_ those_ ?_

They were made in the 1980's, they're like baseball cards of terrorists.
They_ were_ made_ in_ the_ 19 8 0_ ' _ s_ , \ 3 2 ;_ they_ ' _ re_ like_ ba se ba ll_ car ds_ of_ terr ori sts _ ._

Way ahead of their time.
W a y_ ah ead_ of_ their_ time_ ._

That will bring you to my latest project.
Th at_ will_ bri ng_ you_ to_ my_ late st_ project _ ._

I'm in the middle of two projects:  One's called "Psychogeographies."
I_ ' _ m_ in_ the_ mi d dl e_ of_ two_ project s_ : \ 3 2 ; \ 3 2 ;_ One_ ' _ s_ called_ \ 3 2 ; "_ P sy cho ge og rap hi es_ ."_

It's about a six-year project to make 100 of these humans.
It_ ' _ s_ about_ a_ si x _ - _ year_ project _ to_ make_ 1 00 _ of_ these_ human s_ ._

Each one is an archive of our culture,  through our ripped-up media and matter,  whether it's encyclopedias or dictionaries or magazines.
E ach _ one_ is_ an_ archi ve_ of_ our_ culture _ , \ 3 2 ; \ 3 2 ;_ through_ our_ ri pp ed_ - _ up_ medi a_ and_ matter _ , \ 3 2 ; \ 3 2 ;_ whe ther_ it_ ' _ s_ en cy cl ope di as_ or_ dic tion ar ies_ or_ mag azin es_ ._

But each one acts as a sort of an archive in the shape of a human,  and they travel in groups of 20, 4, or 12 at a time.
But_ each_ one_ act s_ as_ a_ sor t_ of_ an_ archi ve_ in_ the_ sha pe_ of_ a_ human_ , \ 3 2 ; \ 3 2 ;_ and_ they_ tra vel _ in_ groups_ of_ 20 _ , \ 3 2 ;_ 4 _ , \ 3 2 ;_ or_ 1 2 _ at_ a_ time_ ._

They're like cells -- they come together, they divide.
They_ ' _ re_ like_ cells _ \ 3 2 ; - - \ 3 2 ;_ they_ come_ together _ , \ 3 2 ;_ they_ div ide _ ._

And you kind of walk through them. It's taking me years.
And_ you_ kind_ of_ wal k_ through_ them_ . \ 3 2 ;_ It_ ' _ s_ tak ing_ me_ years_ ._

Each one is basically a 3,000-pound microscope slide  with a human stuck inside.
E ach _ one_ is_ ba si cally _ a_ 3 _ ,_ 00 0_ - _ po und _ micro sc ope _ sl ide _ \ 3 2 ; \ 3 2 ;_ with_ a_ human_ stu ck_ inside_ ._

This one has a little cave in his chest.
This_ one_ has_ a_ little_ ca ve_ in_ his_ ches t_ ._

That's his head; there's the chest, you can kind of see the beginning.
Th at_ ' _ s_ his_ head _ ; \ 3 2 ;_ there_ ' _ s_ the_ ches t_ , \ 3 2 ;_ you_ can_ kind_ of_ see_ the_ beg inn ing_ ._

I'm going to go down the body for you:  There's a waterfall coming out of his chest,  covering his penis -- or not-penis, or whatever it is,  a kind of androgynous thing.
I_ ' _ m_ going_ to_ go_ down _ the_ body_ for_ you_ : \ 3 2 ; \ 3 2 ;_ There_ ' _ s_ a_ water fall _ com ing_ out_ of_ his_ ches t_ , \ 3 2 ; \ 3 2 ;_ co ver ing_ his_ pe ni s_ \ 3 2 ; - - \ 3 2 ;_ or_ not_ - _ pe ni s_ , \ 3 2 ;_ or_ what ever_ it_ is_ , \ 3 2 ; \ 3 2 ;_ a_ kind_ of_ an d ro g y no us_ thing_ ._

I'll take you quickly through these works,  because I can't explain them for too long.
I_ ' _ ll_ take_ you_ qui ckl y_ through_ these_ work s_ , \ 3 2 ; \ 3 2 ;_ because_ I_ can_ ' _ t_ expl ain _ them_ for_ too_ long _ ._

There are the layers, you can kind of see it.
There_ are_ the_ la ye rs_ , \ 3 2 ;_ you_ can_ kind_ of_ see_ it_ ._

That's a body getting split in half.
Th at_ ' _ s_ a_ body_ get ting_ sp lit _ in_ ha lf _ ._

This one has two heads,  and it's communicating between the two heads.
This_ one_ has_ two_ head s_ , \ 3 2 ; \ 3 2 ;_ and_ it_ ' _ s_ communi cat ing_ between_ the_ two_ head s_ ._

You can see the pills coming out,  going into one head from this weird statue.
You_ can_ see_ the_ pi lls_ com ing_ out_ , \ 3 2 ; \ 3 2 ;_ going_ into_ one_ head _ from_ this_ we ird_ sta tu e_ ._

There's a little forest scene inside the chest cavity.
There_ ' _ s_ a_ little_ fore st_ sc en e_ inside_ the_ ches t_ ca vit y_ ._

Can you see that?
Ca n_ you_ see_ that_ ?_

Anyway, this talk's all about these boxes,  like the boxes we're in.
An y way_ , \ 3 2 ;_ this_ talk_ ' _ s_ all_ about_ these_ box es_ , \ 3 2 ; \ 3 2 ;_ like_ the_ box es_ we_ ' _ re_ in_ ._

This box we're in, the solar system is a box.
This_ box_ we_ ' _ re_ in_ , \ 3 2 ;_ the_ sol ar_ system _ is_ a_ box_ ._

This brings you to my latest box.
This_ bri ng s_ you_ to_ my_ late st_ box_ ._

It's a brick box. It's called Pioneer Works.

Inside of this box is a physicist,  a neuroscientist, a painter, a musician,  a writer, a radio station, a museum, a school,  a publishing arm to disseminate all the content we make there into the world;  a garden.

What do you do when you have a headache?
What_ do_ you_ do_ when_ you_ have_ a_ head ach e_ ?_

You swallow an aspirin.
You_ s wal low _ an_ as pir in_ ._

But for this pill to get to your head, where the pain is,  it goes through your stomach, intestines and various other organs first.
But_ for_ this_ pi ll_ to_ get_ to_ your_ head _ , \ 3 2 ;_ where_ the_ pain _ is_ , \ 3 2 ; \ 3 2 ;_ it_ go es_ through_ your_ sto ma ch_ , \ 3 2 ;_ int esti nes _ and_ var io us_ other_ or ga ns_ first_ ._

Swallowing pills is the most effective and painless way of delivering  any medication in the body.
S wal low ing_ pi lls_ is_ the_ most_ effect ive_ and_ pain less _ way_ of_ del ive ring_ \ 3 2 ; \ 3 2 ;_ any_ medi cat ion_ in_ the_ body_ ._

The downside, though, is that swallowing any medication leads to its dilution.
The_ down side_ , \ 3 2 ;_ thou gh _ , \ 3 2 ;_ is_ that_ s wal low ing_ any_ medi cat ion_ lea ds_ to_ its_ di lu tion_ ._

And this is a big problem, particularly in HIV patients.
And_ this_ is_ a_ bi g_ problem _ , \ 3 2 ;_ particular ly_ in_ HIV_ patients _ ._

When they take their anti-HIV drugs,  these drugs are good for lowering the virus in the blood,  and increasing the CD4 cell counts.
When_ they_ take_ their_ ant i _ - _ HIV_ drugs_ , \ 3 2 ; \ 3 2 ;_ these_ drugs_ are_ good_ for_ low ering _ the_ vi ru s_ in_ the_ blo od_ , \ 3 2 ; \ 3 2 ;_ and_ incre as ing_ the_ C D 4 _ cel l_ cou nt s_ ._

But they are also notorious for their adverse side effects,  but mostly bad, because they get diluted by the time they get to the blood,  and worse, by the time they get to the sites  where it matters most: within the HIV viral reservoirs.
But_ they_ are_ also_ not ori ous_ for_ their_ ad vers e_ side_ effect s_ , \ 3 2 ; \ 3 2 ;_ but_ mo st ly_ bad_ , \ 3 2 ;_ because_ they_ get_ di lu ted_ by_ the_ time_ they_ get_ to_ the_ blo od_ , \ 3 2 ; \ 3 2 ;_ and_ wor se_ , \ 3 2 ;_ by_ the_ time_ they_ get_ to_ the_ site s_ \ 3 2 ; \ 3 2 ;_ where_ it_ matter s_ most_ : \ 3 2 ;_ wi thin _ the_ HIV_ vi ra l_ res erv oi rs_ ._

These areas in the body -- such as the lymph nodes,  the nervous system, as well as the lungs --  where the virus is sleeping,  and will not readily get delivered in the blood  of patients that are under consistent anti-HIV drugs therapy.
These_ are as_ in_ the_ body_ \ 3 2 ; - - \ 3 2 ;_ such_ as_ the_ ly mp h_ no des _ , \ 3 2 ; \ 3 2 ;_ the_ ner vo us_ system _ , \ 3 2 ;_ as_ well _ as_ the_ lu ng s_ \ 3 2 ; - - \ 3 2 ; \ 3 2 ;_ where_ the_ vi ru s_ is_ sl ee pi ng_ , \ 3 2 ; \ 3 2 ;_ and_ will_ not_ read il y_ get_ del ive red_ in_ the_ blo od_ \ 3 2 ; \ 3 2 ;_ of_ patients _ that_ are_ under_ cons ist ent_ ant i _ - _ HIV_ drugs_ ther ap y_ ._

However, upon discontinuation of therapy,  the virus can awake and infect new cells in the blood.
How ever_ , \ 3 2 ;_ up on_ dis continu ation_ of_ ther ap y_ , \ 3 2 ; \ 3 2 ;_ the_ vi ru s_ can_ aw ake _ and_ inf ect _ new_ cells _ in_ the_ blo od_ ._

Now, all this is a big problem in treating HIV with the current drug treatment,  which is a life-long treatment that must be swallowed by patients.
Now_ , \ 3 2 ;_ all_ this_ is_ a_ bi g_ problem _ in_ treat ing_ HIV_ with_ the_ curren t_ drug _ treat ment_ , \ 3 2 ; \ 3 2 ;_ which_ is_ a_ life_ - _ long _ treat ment_ that_ mus t_ be_ s wal low ed_ by_ patients _ ._

One day, I sat and thought,  "Can we deliver anti-HIV directly within its reservoir sites,  without the risk of drug dilution?"
One_ day _ , \ 3 2 ;_ I_ sa t_ and_ thought_ , \ 3 2 ; \ 3 2 ; "_ Ca n_ we_ del ive r_ ant i _ - _ HIV_ di rect ly_ wi thin _ its_ res erv oi r_ site s_ , \ 3 2 ; \ 3 2 ;_ without_ the_ ris k_ of_ drug _ di lu tion_ ?"_

As a laser scientist, the answer was just before my eyes:  Lasers, of course.
As_ a_ las er_ scientist _ , \ 3 2 ;_ the_ answer _ was_ just_ before_ my_ ey es_ : \ 3 2 ; \ 3 2 ;_ L ase rs_ , \ 3 2 ;_ of_ cour se_ ._

If they can be used for dentistry,  for diabetic wound-healing and surgery,  they can be used for anything imaginable,  including transporting drugs into cells.

As a matter of fact, we are currently using laser pulses  to poke or drill extremely tiny holes,  which open and close almost immediately in HIV-infected cells,  in order to deliver drugs within them.
As_ a_ matter _ of_ fact _ , \ 3 2 ;_ we_ are_ curren t ly_ using_ las er_ pu ls es_ \ 3 2 ; \ 3 2 ;_ to_ po ke_ or_ dri ll_ ex tre me ly_ tin y_ ho les_ , \ 3 2 ; \ 3 2 ;_ which_ ope n_ and_ close _ al most_ im medi ate ly_ in_ HIV_ - _ inf ect ed_ cells _ , \ 3 2 ; \ 3 2 ;_ in_ order _ to_ del ive r_ drugs_ wi thin _ them_ ._

"How is that possible?" you may ask.
"_ How _ is_ that_ possib le_ ? " \ 3 2 ;_ you_ may _ ask_ ._

Well, we shine a very powerful but super-tiny laser beam  onto the membrane of HIV-infected cells  while these cells are immersed in liquid containing the drug.
We ll_ , \ 3 2 ;_ we_ shi ne_ a_ very_ power ful_ but_ su per _ - _ tin y_ las er_ bea m_ \ 3 2 ; \ 3 2 ;_ on to_ the_ me m bra ne_ of_ HIV_ - _ inf ect ed_ cells _ \ 3 2 ; \ 3 2 ;_ while_ these_ cells _ are_ im mer sed _ in_ li qui d_ conta ini ng_ the_ drug _ ._

The laser pierces the cell, while the cell swallows the drug  in a matter of microseconds.
The_ las er_ pi er ces _ the_ cel l_ , \ 3 2 ;_ while_ the_ cel l_ s wal low s_ the_ drug _ \ 3 2 ; \ 3 2 ;_ in_ a_ matter _ of_ micro second s_ ._

Before you even know it,  the induced hole becomes immediately repaired.
Be fore _ you_ even_ know_ it_ , \ 3 2 ; \ 3 2 ;_ the_ ind uc ed_ ho le_ bec ome s_ im medi ate ly_ rep air ed_ ._

Now, we are currently testing this technology in test tubes  or in Petri dishes,  but the goal is to get this technology in the human body,  apply it in the human body.

"How is that possible?" you may ask.
"_ How _ is_ that_ possib le_ ? " \ 3 2 ;_ you_ may _ ask_ ._

Well, the answer is: through a three-headed device.
We ll_ , \ 3 2 ;_ the_ answer _ is_ : \ 3 2 ;_ through_ a_ three_ - _ head ed_ de vic e_ ._

Using the first head, which is our laser,  we will make an incision in the site of infection.
U si ng_ the_ first_ head _ , \ 3 2 ;_ which_ is_ our_ las er_ , \ 3 2 ; \ 3 2 ;_ we_ will_ make_ an_ inc is ion_ in_ the_ site _ of_ inf ecti on_ ._

Using the second head, which is a camera,  we meander to the site of infection.
U si ng_ the_ second _ head _ , \ 3 2 ;_ which_ is_ a_ ca mer a_ , \ 3 2 ; \ 3 2 ;_ we_ mean de r_ to_ the_ site _ of_ inf ecti on_ ._

Finally, using a third head, which is a drug-spreading sprinkler,  we deliver the drugs directly at the site of infection,  while the laser is again used to poke those cells open.
F in ally_ , \ 3 2 ;_ using_ a_ th ird_ head _ , \ 3 2 ;_ which_ is_ a_ drug _ - _ sp read ing_ sp ri nk ler _ , \ 3 2 ; \ 3 2 ;_ we_ del ive r_ the_ drugs_ di rect ly_ at_ the_ site _ of_ inf ecti on_ , \ 3 2 ; \ 3 2 ;_ while_ the_ las er_ is_ again _ used_ to_ po ke_ those_ cells _ ope n_ ._

Well, this might not seem like much right now.
We ll_ , \ 3 2 ;_ this_ might_ not_ see m_ like_ much_ right_ now_ ._

But one day, if successful, this technology can lead  to complete eradication of HIV in the body.

Yes. A cure for HIV.

For the past decade,  I've been studying non-state armed groups:  armed organizations like terrorists, insurgents or militias.

I document what these groups do when they're not shooting.

My goal is to better understand these violent actors  and to study ways to encourage transition from violent engagement  to nonviolent confrontation.

I work in the field, in the policy world and in the library.
I_ work_ in_ the_ field _ , \ 3 2 ;_ in_ the_ po lic y_ world_ and_ in_ the_ li bra ry_ ._

Understanding non-state armed groups is key to solving most ongoing conflict,  because war has changed.
U nd ers ta nd ing_ non _ - _ state _ armed_ groups_ is_ ke y_ to_ sol vi ng_ most_ ong oi ng_ conf lic t_ , \ 3 2 ; \ 3 2 ;_ because_ wa r_ has_ change d_ ._

It used to be a contest between states.

No longer.
No _ long er_ ._

It is now a conflict between states and non-state actors.
It_ is_ now_ a_ conf lic t_ between_ state s_ and_ non _ - _ state _ act ors _ ._

For example, of the 216 peace agreements  signed between 1975 and 2011,  196 of them were between a state and a non-state actor.
For_ ex am ple _ , \ 3 2 ;_ of_ the_ 2 1 6_ pe ac e_ ag ree ment s_ \ 3 2 ; \ 3 2 ;_ si g ne d_ between_ 19 7 5 _ and_ 20 1 1 _ , \ 3 2 ; \ 3 2 ;_ 19 6_ of_ them_ were_ between_ a_ state _ and_ a_ non _ - _ state _ act or_ ._

So we need to understand these groups; we need to either engage them  or defeat them in any conflict resolution process that has to be successful.
So_ we_ need_ to_ understand_ these_ groups_ ; \ 3 2 ;_ we_ need_ to_ ei ther_ eng age_ them_ \ 3 2 ; \ 3 2 ;_ or_ def ea t_ them_ in_ any_ conf lic t_ res olution _ process _ that_ has_ to_ be_ su cc ess ful_ ._

So how do we do that?
So_ how_ do_ we_ do_ that_ ?_

We need to know what makes these organizations tick.
We_ need_ to_ know_ what_ make s_ these_ organization s_ ti ck_ ._

We know a lot about how they fight, why they fight,  but no one looks at what they're doing when they're not fighting.

Yet, armed struggle and unarmed politics are related.
Y et_ , \ 3 2 ;_ armed_ str u gg le_ and_ un armed_ po lit ic s_ are_ rel ated _ ._

It is all part of the same organization.

We cannot understand these groups, let alone defeat them,  if we don't have the full picture.

And armed groups today are complex organizations.

Take the Lebanese Hezbollah,  known for its violent confrontation against Israel.
T ake _ the_ L e ba nes e_ He z bo lla h_ , \ 3 2 ; \ 3 2 ;_ know n_ for_ its_ violen t_ conf ron ta tion_ again st_ I s ra el _ ._

But since its creation in the early 1980s,  Hezbollah has also set up a political party,  a social-service network, and a military apparatus.
But_ si nce _ its_ creati on_ in_ the_ ear ly_ 19 8 0 s_ , \ 3 2 ; \ 3 2 ;_ He z bo lla h_ has_ also_ set _ up_ a_ po lit ical_ part y_ , \ 3 2 ; \ 3 2 ;_ a_ social_ - _ ser vic e_ ne tw or k_ , \ 3 2 ;_ and_ a_ mili ta ry_ app ar at us_ ._

Similarly, the Palestinian Hamas,  known for its suicide attacks against Israel,  also runs the Gaza Strip since 2007.
S im il ar ly_ , \ 3 2 ;_ the_ P al esti ni an_ Ha mas _ , \ 3 2 ; \ 3 2 ;_ know n_ for_ its_ su ici de_ att ac ks _ again st_ I s ra el _ , \ 3 2 ; \ 3 2 ;_ also_ ru ns_ the_ G a z a_ S tri p_ si nce _ 20 0 7 _ ._

So these groups do way more than just shoot.
So_ these_ groups_ do_ way_ more_ than_ just_ sho ot _ ._

They multi-task.
They_ mul ti _ - _ ta s k_ ._

They set up complex communication machines --  radio stations, TV channels,  Internet websites and social media strategies.

And up here, you have the ISIS magazine,  printed in English and published to recruit.

Armed groups also invest in complex fund-raising --  not looting, but setting up profitable businesses;  for example, construction companies.
Ar med_ groups_ also_ inv est_ in_ complex_ fu nd_ - _ rais ing_ \ 3 2 ; - - \ 3 2 ; \ 3 2 ;_ not_ lo ot ing_ , \ 3 2 ;_ but_ set ting_ up_ pro fi table _ bu si nes se s_ ; \ 3 2 ; \ 3 2 ;_ for_ ex am ple _ , \ 3 2 ;_ cons tru cti on_ compa ni es_ ._

Now, these activities are keys.
Now_ , \ 3 2 ;_ these_ acti vit ies_ are_ ke ys_ ._

They allow these groups to increase their strength,  increase their funds,  to better recruit and to build their brand.
They_ allow _ these_ groups_ to_ incre ase _ their_ stre ng th_ , \ 3 2 ; \ 3 2 ;_ incre ase _ their_ fu nds _ , \ 3 2 ; \ 3 2 ;_ to_ better_ rec ru it_ and_ to_ build _ their_ bra nd_ ._

Armed groups also do something else:  they build stronger bonds with the population  by investing in social services.
Ar med_ groups_ also_ do_ something_ els e_ : \ 3 2 ; \ 3 2 ;_ they_ build _ str ong er_ bo nds _ with_ the_ po pu la tion_ \ 3 2 ; \ 3 2 ;_ by_ inv esti ng_ in_ social_ ser vic es_ ._

They build schools, they run hospitals,  they set up vocational-training programs or micro-loan programs.
They_ build _ sc hoo ls _ , \ 3 2 ;_ they_ ru n_ ho spi tal s_ , \ 3 2 ; \ 3 2 ;_ they_ set _ up_ vo cat ion al_ - _ tra ini ng_ pro gra ms_ or_ micro _ - _ lo an_ pro gra ms_ ._

Hezbollah offers all of these services and more.
He z bo lla h_ off ers_ all_ of_ these_ ser vic es_ and_ more_ ._

Armed groups also seek to win the population over  by offering something that the state is not providing:  safety and security.
Ar med_ groups_ also_ see k_ to_ wi n_ the_ po pu la tion_ over_ \ 3 2 ; \ 3 2 ;_ by_ off ering _ something_ that_ the_ state _ is_ not_ provi ding_ : \ 3 2 ; \ 3 2 ;_ sa fe ty_ and_ sec uri ty_ ._

The initial rise of the Taliban in war-torn Afghanistan,  or even the beginning of the ascent of ISIS,  can be understood also by looking at these groups' efforts  to provide security.
The_ ini ti al_ ris e_ of_ the_ T ali ba n_ in_ wa r_ - _ to r n_ A f gh an ist an_ , \ 3 2 ; \ 3 2 ;_ or_ even_ the_ beg inn ing_ of_ the_ as cent _ of_ I S I S _ , \ 3 2 ; \ 3 2 ;_ can_ be_ under sto od_ also_ by_ look ing_ at_ these_ groups_ ' \ 3 2 ;_ e ff ort s_ \ 3 2 ; \ 3 2 ;_ to_ provi de_ sec uri ty_ ._

Now, unfortunately, in these cases,  the provision of security came at an unbearably high price  for the population.
Now_ , \ 3 2 ;_ un for tu nat el y_ , \ 3 2 ;_ in_ these_ case s_ , \ 3 2 ; \ 3 2 ;_ the_ provi sion _ of_ sec uri ty_ came_ at_ an_ un bea ra bl y_ high _ pr ic e_ \ 3 2 ; \ 3 2 ;_ for_ the_ po pu la tion_ ._

But in general, providing social services fills a gap,  a governance gap left by the government,  and allows these groups to increase their strength  and their power.
But_ in_ gener al_ , \ 3 2 ;_ provi ding_ social_ ser vic es_ fi lls_ a_ ga p_ , \ 3 2 ; \ 3 2 ;_ a_ govern ance_ ga p_ le ft _ by_ the_ govern ment_ , \ 3 2 ; \ 3 2 ;_ and_ allow s_ these_ groups_ to_ incre ase _ their_ stre ng th_ \ 3 2 ; \ 3 2 ;_ and_ their_ power_ ._

For example, the 2006 electoral victory of the Palestinian Hamas  cannot be understood without acknowledging the group's social work.
For_ ex am ple _ , \ 3 2 ;_ the_ 20 0 6_ ele ct or al_ vic to ry_ of_ the_ P al esti ni an_ Ha mas _ \ 3 2 ; \ 3 2 ;_ can not_ be_ under sto od_ without_ ac know led gi ng_ the_ group _ ' _ s_ social_ work_ ._

Now, this is a really complex picture,  yet in the West, when we look at armed groups,  we only think of the violent side.
Now_ , \ 3 2 ;_ this_ is_ a_ really_ complex_ pi ct ure_ , \ 3 2 ; \ 3 2 ;_ ye t_ in_ the_ We st_ , \ 3 2 ;_ when_ we_ look_ at_ armed_ groups_ , \ 3 2 ; \ 3 2 ;_ we_ only_ think_ of_ the_ violen t_ side_ ._

But that's not enough to understand these groups' strength,  strategy or long-term vision.
But_ that_ ' _ s_ not_ en ou gh _ to_ understand_ these_ groups_ ' \ 3 2 ;_ stre ng th_ , \ 3 2 ; \ 3 2 ;_ stra te g y_ or_ long _ - _ ter m_ vis ion_ ._

These groups are hybrid.
These_ groups_ are_ h y bri d_ ._

They rise because they fill a gap left by the government,  and they emerge to be both armed and political,  engage in violent struggle and provide governance.
They_ ris e_ because_ they_ fi ll_ a_ ga p_ le ft _ by_ the_ govern ment_ , \ 3 2 ; \ 3 2 ;_ and_ they_ eme r ge_ to_ be_ bot h_ armed_ and_ po lit ical_ , \ 3 2 ; \ 3 2 ;_ eng age_ in_ violen t_ str u gg le_ and_ provi de_ govern ance_ ._

And the more these organizations are complex and sophisticated,  the less we can think of them as the opposite of a state.
And_ the_ more_ these_ organization s_ are_ complex_ and_ so phi stic ated _ , \ 3 2 ; \ 3 2 ;_ the_ less _ we_ can_ think_ of_ them_ as_ the_ op pos ite _ of_ a_ state _ ._

Now, what do you call a group like Hezbollah?
Now_ , \ 3 2 ;_ what_ do_ you_ call_ a_ group _ like_ He z bo lla h_ ?_

They run part of a territory, they administer all their functions,  they pick up the garbage, they run the sewage system.
They_ ru n_ part_ of_ a_ terr it ory _ , \ 3 2 ;_ they_ ad min ist er_ all_ their_ function s_ , \ 3 2 ; \ 3 2 ;_ they_ pi ck_ up_ the_ ga r ba ge_ , \ 3 2 ;_ they_ ru n_ the_ se wa ge_ system _ ._

Is this a state? Is it a rebel group?
I s_ this_ a_ state _ ? \ 3 2 ;_ I s_ it_ a_ re be l_ group _ ?_

Or maybe something else, something different and new?
O r_ may be_ something_ els e_ , \ 3 2 ;_ something_ different_ and_ new_ ?_

And what about ISIS?
And_ what_ about_ I S I S _ ?_

We live in a world of states, non-states, and in-between,  and the more states are weak, like in the Middle East today,  the more non-state actors step in and fill that gap.
We_ live_ in_ a_ world_ of_ state s_ , \ 3 2 ;_ non _ - _ state s_ , \ 3 2 ;_ and_ in_ - _ between_ , \ 3 2 ; \ 3 2 ;_ and_ the_ more_ state s_ are_ we ak _ , \ 3 2 ;_ like_ in_ the_ M i d dl e_ E ast _ today_ , \ 3 2 ; \ 3 2 ;_ the_ more_ non _ - _ state _ act ors _ step_ in_ and_ fi ll_ that_ ga p_ ._

This matters for governments, because to counter these groups,  they will have to invest more in non-military tools.
This_ matter s_ for_ govern ment s_ , \ 3 2 ;_ because_ to_ cou nt er_ these_ groups_ , \ 3 2 ; \ 3 2 ;_ they_ will_ have_ to_ inv est_ more_ in_ non _ - _ mili ta ry_ too ls _ ._

Filling that governance gap  has to be at the center of any sustainable approach.

I have passionate opinions about gender equality,  but I worry that to freely accept the label of "feminist,"  would not be fair to good feminists.

I'm a feminist, but I'm a rather bad one.

Oh, so I call myself a Bad Feminist.
O h_ , \ 3 2 ;_ so_ I_ call_ myself_ a_ Ba d_ F em ini st_ ._

Or at least, I wrote an essay,  and then I wrote a book called "Bad Feminist,"  and then in interviews, people started calling me The Bad Feminist.

So, what started as a bit of an inside joke with myself  and a willful provocation,  has become a thing.

Let me take a step back.

When I was younger,  I had strange ideas about feminists  as hairy, angry, man-hating, sex-hating women --  as if those are bad things.

These days, I look at how women are treated the world over,  and anger, in particular, seems like a perfectly reasonable response.

But back then,  I worried about the tone people used  when suggesting I might be a feminist.

The feminist label was an accusation,  it was an "F" word, and not a nice one.

I was labeled a woman who doesn't play by the rules, who expects too much,  who thinks far too highly of myself,  by daring to believe I'm equal --  -- superior to a man.
I_ was_ lab ele d_ a_ woman _ who_ does n_ ' _ t_ play _ by_ the_ ru les_ , \ 3 2 ;_ who_ expe ct s_ too_ much_ , \ 3 2 ; \ 3 2 ;_ who_ thin ks _ fa r_ too_ high ly_ of_ myself_ , \ 3 2 ; \ 3 2 ;_ by_ da ring_ to_ believe_ I_ ' _ m_ equ al_ \ 3 2 ; - - \ 3 2 ; \ 3 2 ; - - \ 3 2 ;_ su per io r_ to_ a_ man _ ._

You don't want to be that rebel woman,  and cannot imagine being anyone else.

As I got older, I began to accept  that I am, indeed, a feminist, and a proud one.

Without this kind of inclusion, our feminism is nothing.

If a woman wants to take her husband's name,  that is her choice, and it is not my place to judge.

If a woman chooses to stay home to raise her children, I embrace that choice, too.
If_ a_ woman _ cho ose s_ to_ sta y_ home _ to_ rais e_ her_ children_ , \ 3 2 ;_ I_ emb ra ce_ that_ choice _ , \ 3 2 ;_ too_ ._

The problem is not that she makes herself economically vulnerable in that choice;  the problem is that our society is set up to make women economically vulnerable when they choose.

Let's deal with that.

I reject the mainstream feminism  that has historically ignored or deflected the needs  in favor of supporting white, middle- and upper-class straight women.

We have this tendency to put visible feminists on a pedestal.

When they disappoint us,  we gleefully knock them from the very pedestal we put them on.

Too many women,  particularly groundbreaking women and industry leaders,  are afraid to be labeled as feminists.

They're afraid to stand up and say, "Yes, I am a feminist,"  for fear of what that label means,  for fear of being unable to live up to unrealistic expectations.

We go far beyond reasonable, constructive criticism,  to dissecting any given woman's feminism,  tearing it apart until there's nothing left.

This is true for so many reasons,  but first and foremost, I say this because once upon a time,  my voice was stolen from me,  and feminism helped me to get my voice back.

Just after Christmas last year,  132 kids in California got the measles  by either visiting Disneyland  or being exposed to someone who'd been there.

One of the tragic things about this outbreak  is that measles, which can be fatal to a child with a weakened immune system,  is one of the most easily preventable diseases in the world.

An effective vaccine against it  has been available for more than half a century,  but many of the kids involved in the Disneyland outbreak  had not been vaccinated  because their parents were afraid  of something allegedly even worse:  autism.

For most of the 20th century,  autism was considered an incredibly rare condition.

For decades, the prevalence estimates remained stable  at just three or four children in 10,000.

For most of the 20th century,  clinicians told one story  about what autism is and how it was discovered,  but that story turned out to be wrong,  and the consequences of it  are having a devastating impact on global public health.

There was a second, more accurate story of autism  which had been lost and forgotten  in obscure corners of the clinical literature.

This_ second _ story_ te lls_ us_ everything_ about_ how_ we_ got_ here_ \ 3 2 ; \ 3 2 ;_ and_ where_ we_ need_ to_ go_ next_ ._

The first story starts with a child psychiatrist at Johns Hopkins Hospital  named Leo Kanner.
The_ first_ story_ start s_ with_ a_ child _ psych ia tri st_ at_ J o hn s_ Ho p ki ns_ Ho spi tal _ \ 3 2 ; \ 3 2 ;_ na med_ L e o_ Kanner _ ._

In 1943, Kanner published a paper  describing 11 young patients who seemed to inhabit private worlds,  ignoring the people around them,  even their own parents.
In_ 19 4 3 _ , \ 3 2 ;_ Kanner _ publish ed_ a_ paper _ \ 3 2 ; \ 3 2 ;_ des cr ib ing_ 1 1 _ you ng_ patients _ who_ see med_ to_ in ha bit_ pr i va te_ world s_ , \ 3 2 ; \ 3 2 ;_ ig nor ing_ the_ people_ around_ them_ , \ 3 2 ; \ 3 2 ;_ even_ their_ own_ parents_ ._

They could amuse themselves for hours  by flapping their hands in front of their faces,  but they were panicked by little things  like their favorite toy being moved from its usual place without their knowledge.
They_ could_ am use _ the ms el ves_ for_ ho ur s_ \ 3 2 ; \ 3 2 ;_ by_ fl app ing_ their_ hand s_ in_ front_ of_ their_ face s_ , \ 3 2 ; \ 3 2 ;_ but_ they_ were_ pa ni ck ed_ by_ little_ things_ \ 3 2 ; \ 3 2 ;_ like_ their_ fa vo rit e_ to y_ being_ mov ed_ from_ its_ us ual _ place_ without_ their_ know led ge_ ._

Based on the patients who were brought to his clinic,  Kanner speculated that autism is very rare.
Ba sed _ on_ the_ patients _ who_ were_ bro ugh t_ to_ his_ clinic _ , \ 3 2 ; \ 3 2 ;_ Kanner _ spec ul ated _ that_ autism_ is_ very_ rar e_ ._

By the 1950s, as the world's leading authority on the subject,  he declared that he had seen less than 150 true cases of his syndrome  while fielding referrals from as far away as South Africa.
B y_ the_ 19 50 s_ , \ 3 2 ;_ as_ the_ world_ ' _ s_ lea ding_ aut ho rit y_ on_ the_ su b j ect _ , \ 3 2 ; \ 3 2 ;_ he_ dec la red_ that_ he_ had_ see n_ less _ than_ 1 50 _ true _ case s_ of_ his_ sy nd ro me_ \ 3 2 ; \ 3 2 ;_ while_ field ing_ ref er ra ls _ from_ as_ fa r_ away_ as_ So ut h_ A fr ica _ ._

That's actually not surprising,  because Kanner's criteria for diagnosing autism  were incredibly selective.
Th at_ ' _ s_ act ually_ not_ sur pr is ing_ , \ 3 2 ; \ 3 2 ;_ because_ Kanner _ ' _ s_ crit er ia _ for_ diagnos ing_ autism_ \ 3 2 ; \ 3 2 ;_ were_ incre di bl y_ se lec ti ve_ ._

For example, he discouraged giving the diagnosis to children who had seizures  but now we know that epilepsy is very common in autism.
For_ ex am ple _ , \ 3 2 ;_ he_ dis cour age d_ gi vi ng_ the_ diagnos is_ to_ children_ who_ had_ se i z ure s_ \ 3 2 ; \ 3 2 ;_ but_ now_ we_ know_ that_ ep il ep sy _ is_ very_ comm on_ in_ autism_ ._

He once bragged that he had turned nine out of 10 kids  referred to his office as autistic by other clinicians  without giving them an autism diagnosis.
He _ on ce_ bra gg ed_ that_ he_ had_ turned_ ni ne_ out_ of_ 10_ kids_ \ 3 2 ; \ 3 2 ;_ ref er red_ to_ his_ off ic e_ as_ autistic_ by_ other_ clinic ia ns_ \ 3 2 ; \ 3 2 ;_ without_ gi vi ng_ them_ an_ autism_ diagnos is_ ._

Kanner was a smart guy,  but a number of his theories didn't pan out.
Kanner _ was_ a_ sm art _ gu y_ , \ 3 2 ; \ 3 2 ;_ but_ a_ number_ of_ his_ the ori es_ di d n_ ' _ t_ pa n_ out_ ._

He classified autism as a form of infantile psychosis  caused by cold and unaffectionate parents.
He _ cla ssi fi ed_ autism_ as_ a_ form_ of_ inf ant il e_ psych os is_ \ 3 2 ; \ 3 2 ;_ cause d_ by_ col d_ and_ un aff ecti on ate_ parents_ ._

These children, he said,  had been kept neatly in a refrigerator that didn't defrost.

At the same time, however,  Kanner noticed that some of his young patients  had special abilities that clustered in certain areas  like music, math and memory.
A t_ the_ same_ time_ , \ 3 2 ;_ ho we ver _ , \ 3 2 ; \ 3 2 ;_ Kanner _ noti ce d_ that_ some_ of_ his_ you ng_ patients _ \ 3 2 ; \ 3 2 ;_ had_ speci al_ abilit ies_ that_ cl ust ere d_ in_ cer tai n_ are as_ \ 3 2 ; \ 3 2 ;_ like_ music _ , \ 3 2 ;_ mat h_ and_ me mor y_ ._

One boy in his clinic  could distinguish between 18 symphonies before he turned two.
One_ bo y_ in_ his_ clinic _ \ 3 2 ; \ 3 2 ;_ could_ dist ing u ish _ between_ 1 8 _ sy mp ho ni es_ before_ he_ turned_ two_ ._

When his mother put on one of his favorite records,  he would correctly declare, "Beethoven!"

But Kanner took a dim view of these abilities,  claiming that the kids were just regurgitating things  they'd heard their pompous parents say,  As a result, autism became a source of shame and stigma for families,  and two generations of autistic children  were shipped off to institutions for their own good,  becoming invisible to the world at large.
But_ Kanner _ too k_ a_ di m_ vi ew _ of_ these_ abilit ies_ , \ 3 2 ; \ 3 2 ;_ cla im ing_ that_ the_ kids_ were_ just_ re gu r gi ta ting_ things_ \ 3 2 ; \ 3 2 ;_ they_ ' _ d_ hear d_ their_ po mp ous_ parents_ say_ , \ 3 2 ; \ 3 2 ;_ As_ a_ res ult _ , \ 3 2 ;_ autism_ bec ame _ a_ so ur ce_ of_ sha me_ and_ sti g ma _ for_ fa mili es_ , \ 3 2 ; \ 3 2 ;_ and_ two_ gener ation s_ of_ autistic_ children_ \ 3 2 ; \ 3 2 ;_ were_ shi pp ed_ off _ to_ inst it uti ons _ for_ their_ own_ good_ , \ 3 2 ; \ 3 2 ;_ bec om ing_ inv is ible_ to_ the_ world_ at_ large _ ._

Amazingly, it wasn't until the 1970s  that researchers began to test Kanner's theory that autism was rare.

Lorna Wing was a cognitive psychologist in London  who thought that Kanner's theory of refrigerator parenting  were "bloody stupid," as she told me.
Lo rna _ W ing_ was_ a_ co g ni ti ve_ psych ologi st_ in_ Lo nd on_ \ 3 2 ; \ 3 2 ;_ who_ thought_ that_ Kanner _ ' _ s_ the ory _ of_ ref rig er at or_ pare nt ing_ \ 3 2 ; \ 3 2 ;_ were_ \ 3 2 ; "_ blo od y_ stu pi d_ , " \ 3 2 ;_ as_ she_ to ld _ me_ ._

She and her husband John were warm and affectionate people,  and they had a profoundly autistic daughter named Susie.
Sh e_ and_ her_ hu s ba nd_ J o hn _ were_ wa r m_ and_ aff ecti on ate_ people_ , \ 3 2 ; \ 3 2 ;_ and_ they_ had_ a_ pro fo und ly_ autistic_ da ugh ter _ na med_ S us ie _ ._

Lorna and John knew how hard it was to raise a child like Susie  without support services,  and the other resources that are out of reach without a diagnosis.
Lo rna _ and_ J o hn _ k new_ how_ hard _ it_ was_ to_ rais e_ a_ child _ like_ S us ie _ \ 3 2 ; \ 3 2 ;_ without_ suppo rt_ ser vic es_ , \ 3 2 ; \ 3 2 ;_ and_ the_ other_ res ou rc es_ that_ are_ out_ of_ re ach _ without_ a_ diagnos is_ ._

To make the case to the National Health Service  that more resources were needed for autistic children and their families,  Lorna and her colleague Judith Gould  decided to do something that should have been done 30 years earlier.
To _ make_ the_ case _ to_ the_ N ation al_ He al th_ S erv ic e_ \ 3 2 ; \ 3 2 ;_ that_ more_ res ou rc es_ were_ need ed_ for_ autistic_ children_ and_ their_ fa mili es_ , \ 3 2 ; \ 3 2 ;_ Lo rna _ and_ her_ colle ag ue _ J ud ith _ G ou ld _ \ 3 2 ; \ 3 2 ;_ deci ded _ to_ do_ something_ that_ should_ have_ been_ do ne_ 30 _ years_ ear lie r_ ._

They undertook a study of autism prevalence in the general population.

They pounded the pavement in a London suburb called Camberwell  to try to find autistic children in the community.

What they saw made clear that Kanner's model was way too narrow,  while the reality of autism was much more colorful and diverse.

Some kids couldn't talk at all,  while others waxed on at length about their fascination with astrophysics,  dinosaurs or the genealogy of royalty.
So me_ kids_ cou ld n_ ' _ t_ talk_ at_ all_ , \ 3 2 ; \ 3 2 ;_ while_ other s_ wa x ed_ on_ at_ len g th_ about_ their_ fa sci nat ion_ with_ ast ro ph ys ic s_ , \ 3 2 ; \ 3 2 ;_ di no sa ur s_ or_ the_ gen ea lo g y_ of_ ro y al ty_ ._

In other words, these children didn't fit into nice, neat boxes,  as Judith put it,  and they saw lots of them,  way more than Kanner's monolithic model would have predicted.
In_ other_ wor ds_ , \ 3 2 ;_ these_ children_ di d n_ ' _ t_ fi t_ into_ ni ce_ , \ 3 2 ;_ ne at_ box es_ , \ 3 2 ; \ 3 2 ;_ as_ J ud ith _ put_ it_ , \ 3 2 ; \ 3 2 ;_ and_ they_ sa w_ lo ts_ of_ them_ , \ 3 2 ; \ 3 2 ;_ way_ more_ than_ Kanner _ ' _ s_ mon ol ith ic_ mo del _ would_ have_ pre dic ted_ ._

At first, they were at a loss to make sense of their data.

How had no one noticed these children before?
How _ had_ no_ one_ noti ce d_ these_ children_ before_ ?_

But then Lorna came upon a reference to a paper that had been published  in German in 1944,  the year after Kanner's paper,  and then forgotten,  buried with the ashes of a terrible time  that no one wanted to remember or think about.

Kanner knew about this competing paper,  It had never even been translated into English,  but luckily, Lorna's husband spoke German,  and he translated it for her.

The paper offered an alternate story of autism.

Its author was a man named Hans Asperger,  who ran a combination clinic and residential school  in Vienna in the 1930s.

Asperger's ideas about teaching children with learning differences  were progressive even by contemporary standards.

Mornings at his clinic began with exercise classes set to music,  and the children put on plays on Sunday afternoons.

Instead of blaming parents for causing autism,  Asperger framed it as a lifelong, polygenetic disability  that requires compassionate forms of support and accommodations  over the course of one's whole life.

Rather than treating the kids in his clinic like patients,  Asperger called them his little professors,  and enlisted their help in developing methods of education  that were particularly suited to them.

Crucially, Asperger viewed autism as a diverse continuum  that spans an astonishing range of giftedness and disability.
C ru ci ally_ , \ 3 2 ;_ As per ger _ vi ew ed_ autism_ as_ a_ div ers e_ continu um _ \ 3 2 ; \ 3 2 ;_ that_ spa ns_ an_ ast on ish ing_ ra nge _ of_ gi ft ed nes s_ and_ dis abilit y_ ._

He believed that autism and autistic traits are common  and always have been,  seeing aspects of this continuum in familiar archetypes from pop culture  like the socially awkward scientist  and the absent-minded professor.
He _ be lie ved_ that_ autism_ and_ autistic_ tra its_ are_ comm on_ \ 3 2 ; \ 3 2 ;_ and_ always_ have_ been_ , \ 3 2 ; \ 3 2 ;_ see ing_ as pe ct s_ of_ this_ continu um _ in_ fa mili ar_ ar che ty pe s_ from_ po p_ culture _ \ 3 2 ; \ 3 2 ;_ like_ the_ soci ally_ aw k ward _ scientist _ \ 3 2 ; \ 3 2 ;_ and_ the_ ab se nt_ - _ min ded _ pro fe ss or_ ._

He went so far as to say,  it seems that for success in science and art,  a dash of autism is essential.
He _ we nt_ so_ fa r_ as_ to_ say_ , \ 3 2 ; \ 3 2 ;_ it_ see ms_ that_ for_ su cc ess _ in_ sci ence_ and_ art _ , \ 3 2 ; \ 3 2 ;_ a_ da sh_ of_ autism_ is_ ess enti al_ ._

Lorna and Judith realized that Kanner had been as wrong about autism being rare  as he had been about parents causing it.
Lo rna _ and_ J ud ith _ realized _ that_ Kanner _ had_ been_ as_ wrong_ about_ autism_ being_ rar e_ \ 3 2 ; \ 3 2 ;_ as_ he_ had_ been_ about_ parents_ ca using_ it_ ._

Over the next several years,  they quietly worked with the American Psychiatric Association  to broaden the criteria for diagnosis  to reflect the diversity of what they called "the autism spectrum."
O ver _ the_ next_ se ver al_ years_ , \ 3 2 ; \ 3 2 ;_ they_ qui et ly_ work ed_ with_ the_ A mer ica n_ P sy chi at ri c_ As soci ation_ \ 3 2 ; \ 3 2 ;_ to_ bro ade n_ the_ crit er ia _ for_ diagnos is_ \ 3 2 ; \ 3 2 ;_ to_ ref lec t_ the_ div ers ity_ of_ what_ they_ called_ \ 3 2 ; "_ the_ autism_ spec tru m_ ."_

In the late '80s and early 1990s,  their changes went into effect,  swapping out Kanner's narrow model  for Asperger's broad and inclusive one.
In_ the_ late _ \ 3 2 ; ' _ 8 0 s_ and_ ear ly_ 19 9 0 s_ , \ 3 2 ; \ 3 2 ;_ their_ change s_ we nt_ into_ effect _ , \ 3 2 ; \ 3 2 ;_ s wa pp ing_ out_ Kanner _ ' _ s_ na rr ow_ mo del _ \ 3 2 ; \ 3 2 ;_ for_ As per ger _ ' _ s_ bro ad _ and_ inclu si ve_ one_ ._

These changes weren't happening in a vacuum.
These_ change s_ we re n_ ' _ t_ happen ing_ in_ a_ vac u um _ ._

By coincidence, as Lorna and Judith worked behind the scenes  to reform the criteria,  people all over the world were seeing an autistic adult for the first time.

Before "Rain Man" came out in 1988,  only a tiny, ingrown circle of experts knew what autism looked like,  but after Dustin Hoffman's unforgettable performance as Raymond Babbitt  earned "Rain Man" four Academy Awards,  pediatricians, psychologists,  teachers and parents all over the world knew what autism looked like.
Be fore _ \ 3 2 ; "_ R ain _ Ma n_ " \ 3 2 ;_ came_ out_ in_ 19 8 8 _ , \ 3 2 ; \ 3 2 ;_ only_ a_ tin y_ , \ 3 2 ;_ ing ro w n_ ci rc le_ of_ expe rt s_ k new_ what_ autism_ look ed_ like_ , \ 3 2 ; \ 3 2 ;_ but_ after_ D ust in_ Ho ff man _ ' _ s_ un for get table _ per form ance_ as_ R a y mon d_ Ba b bit t_ \ 3 2 ; \ 3 2 ;_ ear ne d_ \ 3 2 ; "_ R ain _ Ma n_ " \ 3 2 ;_ four_ A ca dem y_ A ward s_ , \ 3 2 ; \ 3 2 ;_ pe di at ri ci an s_ , \ 3 2 ;_ psych ologi sts _ , \ 3 2 ; \ 3 2 ;_ tea che rs_ and_ parents_ all_ over_ the_ world_ k new_ what_ autism_ look ed_ like_ ._

Coincidentally, at the same time,  the first easy-to-use clinical tests for diagnosing autism were introduced.
Co inc ident ally_ , \ 3 2 ;_ at_ the_ same_ time_ , \ 3 2 ; \ 3 2 ;_ the_ first_ eas y_ - _ to_ - _ use _ clinic al_ test s_ for_ diagnos ing_ autism_ were_ int ro duc ed_ ._

You no longer had to have a connection to that tiny circle of experts  to get your child evaluated.

The combination of "Rain Man,"  the changes to the criteria, and the introduction of these tests  created a network effect,  a perfect storm of autism awareness.

The number of diagnoses started to soar,  just as Lorna and Judith predicted, indeed hoped, that it would,  enabling autistic people and their families  to finally get the support and services they deserved.

Then Andrew Wakefield came along  to blame the spike in diagnoses on vaccines,  a simple, powerful,  and seductively believable story  that was as wrong as Kanner's theory  that autism was rare.

If the CDC's current estimate,  that one in 68 kids in America are on the spectrum, is correct,  autistics are one of the largest minority groups in the world.

In recent years, autistic people have come together on the Internet  to reject the notion that they are puzzles to be solved  by the next medical breakthrough,  coining the term "neurodiversity"  to celebrate the varieties of human cognition.
In_ rec ent_ years_ , \ 3 2 ;_ autistic_ people_ have_ come_ together _ on_ the_ In tern et_ \ 3 2 ; \ 3 2 ;_ to_ re j ect _ the_ noti on_ that_ they_ are_ pu z z les_ to_ be_ sol ved_ \ 3 2 ; \ 3 2 ;_ by_ the_ next_ medical_ brea k through_ , \ 3 2 ; \ 3 2 ;_ co ini ng_ the_ ter m_ \ 3 2 ; "_ ne ur od ive rs ity_ " \ 3 2 ; \ 3 2 ;_ to_ cel e bra te_ the_ var ie tie s_ of_ human_ co g ni tion_ ._

One way to understand neurodiversity  is to think in terms of human operating systems.

By autistic standards, the normal human brain  is easily distractable,  obsessively social,  and suffers from a deficit of attention to detail.

[Seventy] years later, we're still catching up to Asperger,  who believed that the "cure" for the most disabling aspects of autism  is to be found in understanding teachers,  accommodating employers,  supportive communities,  and parents who have faith in their children's potential.
